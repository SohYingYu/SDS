rules,CNA,Health,Active Ageing,15/11/2024 16:01,,,,"singapore amid a spate of recent food poisoning cases, industry players and consultants told cna that a manpower crunch is one major reason why some caterers are struggling with food safety lapses in singapore. they said volatile staffing is increasing the odds of human error at a time when demand has surged to new peaks since the covid-19 pandemic. businesses are facing an uptick in orders of up to 10 per cent in the last two years, but there has been no significant increase in the number of new catering businesses over the past three to four years, according association of catering professionals singapore (acaps). this worsens during peak periods, like the upcoming christmas festive season or major public holidays. when you have a shortage of manpower, there are a lot of things you will not be able to maintain. for example, the basic or the minimum cooking (time) for a particular food item might not be met, said food safety consultant jesse tan. such undercooked food can lead to food poisoning, among other causes like contamination, improper thawing of meat, pest infestations, and using expired food products. food safety has been thrown inspotlight on the back of food poisoning outbreaks in the past few months. these include an incident at the bytedances office where 130 people fell ill after eating food supplied by caterers yun hai yao at northpoint city and pu tien services at senoko south road. most recently, 51 people suffered gastroenteritis after eating food provided by stamford catering services. outbreaks were also reported at higher-end dining outlets like chinese eatery peach garden and pan pacific hotel's edge buffet restaurant. under a new bill tabled in parliament on tuesday (nov 12), stiffer penalties could soon be imposed on those who flout food safety rules. acaps, which represents more than 200 catering operators, noted that many businesses rely on a flexible workforce of part-timers and contract workers to scale up operations during busy periods. however, not all the estimated 800,000 registered food workers both full-time and part-time in singapore are available during the peak season. the association attributed the recent spike in demand from caterers gradual phasing out of work-from-home arrangements. more in-person meetings and events have led to more requests for catering services. more weddings and large-scale social gatherings that were delayed during the pandemic have also been held. to address demand during these periods, the association said some catering companies collaborate with staffing agencies to source short-term employees. however, mr tan said existing workers shoulder more workload if their employers are unable to find more workers, which increases the risk of mistakes, added mr tan. his consultancy firm advanced consultancy has seen a 30 per cent rise in requests from clients to audit their kitchens this year so far, compared with previous years. a lot of companies are getting more proactive, because they feel that prevention is always better than cure, mr tan added. these mock audits can come in the form of a surprise check, which mr tan said most of their clients which include food manufacturers, restaurants and caterers prefer. most of these premises would have food handlers who have already gone through all these basic food hygiene courses, but sometimes they might be blind to certain spots within the premises, he noted. so our job is to help them identify what are the missing pieces and what are the spots that are not visible to them, and then we point it out to them, and then tell them how to improve. the singapore food agency also said that beyond regular inspections, it conducts targeted operations based on data analytics which identify licensees with poor track records, those with a history of foodborne outbreaks or those flagged by public feedback. during such inspections, the agency looks out for pest infestations, proper separation of raw and cooked food, and whether food appliances are kept clean, among other things. at rasel catering, 8 per cent more staff are hired to handle orders during the year-end festive period, when orders go up 20 per cent more than usual. its managing director alan tan said the firm makes plans by organising staff schedules, stocking the kitchen fully, making sure everyone is on the same page during high-pressure situations, and ensuring the firm does not take more orders than it can handle. the caterer was fined s$4,800 last year for multiple hygiene lapses after 345 people fell ill from gastroenteritis. now, it has turned to technology to beef up food safety something acaps is pushing the industry to do. it invested about s$200,000 (us$148,800) in installing high-tech gadgets to cut down on human contact with food and speed up workflows. one technology the company has invested in is ozonators, or ozone generators, that release ozone in the air to help kill bacteria and eliminate strong odours. other various sensors keep air quality and temperature in check, ensuring they are within safe levels. another machine automatically keeps dishes like chicken warm after they have been baked. the company also sends food samples for microbiology testing as frequently as every month, performs equipment swab tests, and conducts surprise checks on kitchen staff to remind them to maintain personal hygiene. meanwhile, more restaurants and caterers are sending their food handlers for training, according to consultancy firm isrc, which has seen an uptick in signups. it conducts basic food safety courses offered at three levels, the lowest of which is required for all food handlers by law. it teaches things like personal hygiene. those who attend the highest-level course are taught how to address food safety lapses and manage manpower through proper cleaning and cooking rosters. learners are also taught how to set up separate workstations for raw, cooked and ready-to-eat food to reduce the risk of contamination. many food establishments are now adopting recognised food safety management systems as clients increasingly require them to have food safety certification, said isrc senior food safety consultant chan fong ying. the recent high profile food poisoning cases (also created) the urgency for businesses to implement a more comprehensive food safety management system, to protect public health and also to prevent contamination.",1

travellers started walking along the pavement on the causeway, towards johor. but when the men crossed over other side where the railway track was, immigration and checkpoints authority (ica) officers at the checkpoint received an alert immediately. if these travellers are able to enter malaysia illegally, theres every chance of them (later) entering singapore illegally as well, said ica officer mohd syamil mohd yusof, who was on duty when the incident happened on aug 18. officers quickly mobilised, splitting into two teams one searching nearer the border with malaysia and another closer checkpoint. meanwhile, one of syamils colleagues conducted a sweep of the water pipelines to ensure nobody was hiding between the pipes. the police coast guard was also deployed to scour the waters. but there was no sign of the quartet, last seen on closed-circuit television near the tracks. im quite frustrated because we came here as fast as we could, said syamil at the scene. the ica had already logged the mens details, however, ready to question them if they attempt to re-enter singapore. such situations are all in a days work for the officers at woodlands checkpoint, who man the worlds busiest land crossing, with more than 300,000 travellers passing through daily. the pressure intensifies during long weekends. a lot more travellers mean that they could be targets for armed attackers, said syamil. so we project a lot more presence and pay a lot more attention crowd. he is part of the first response team officers who are trained to react a range of incidents, from overcrowding to medical emergencies to security threats such as potential assailants. at peak periods, some travellers are also tempted to smuggle contraband, working on the assumption that travel chaos will provide cover for illicit activities, with officers too overwhelmed to notice. that is where search and examination officers come in, inspecting cargo, luggage and vehicles to intercept prohibited items. people always have this expectation that its always the departure side thatll experience heavy traffic, said one of the officers, illy erica mohd johaness. but here at arrival cargo, it doesnt mean that were relaxed. cnas two-part series, inside woodlands checkpoint, follows ica officers in their behind-the-scenes efforts to apprehend suspected lawbreakers, uncover contraband goods and keep up with the flow of people passing through the border. watch part 1 worlds busiest land crossing inside singapore woodlands checkpoint (4608) one of the cases has even ended up in court now. here are three reasons to watch this exclusive access to immigration control. amidst all the traffic at woodlands checkpoint, thousands of lorries come in every day. all of them are scanned and every radiographic image must be cleared in 10 seconds to keep traffic moving, said ica image analyst darren oh. within that time, on one occasion when he was screening a lorry carrying packet drinks, he noticed something unusual an area towards the front of the vehicle appeared lighter on the scan. he knew from experience that a whole consignment of liquids should appear dark. im quite confident that this is a smuggling case, he said, calling for the lorry to undergo enhanced checks. its going to be a big case. indeed, it turned out to be one of the icas largest hauls, according to search and examination officer mohd masri mohd rahman. eventually, about 3,250 cartons of contraband cigarettes were extracted from the vehicle. while the cartons were in different packaging from the declared consignment, the officers could not rule out the possibility of other hidden contraband. so they had to escort the lorry to a secure area for a thorough inspection, with officers in the operations room locking down the zone to prevent the driver from taking off in the vehicle while under escort. any lockdown affects other vehicles as traffic is brought to a standstill, which makes us want to get this lockdown and escorting done as quickly as possible, said erica. considering the weight of the boxes of drinks, the extraction was challenging and required additional manpower. but at the same time, i feel its fulfilling because we managed to extract so much contraband, erica added. combating smuggling is not the only reason for a lockdown at the checkpoint. a full lockdown affecting travellers, vehicles and any form of conveyance can be triggered by a dash-through or any attempt to evade immigration clearance. in fact, on the eve of nationai day, the panic alarm was activated. upon reviewing the cctv footage, luqman hakim shaifoddin, the watch team leader, discovered that a lorry driver had driven through the barrier before it was raised. once weve established the area that the panic alarm was activated for, we can lift the lockdown in other areas of the checkpoint just to alleviate the traffic, said luqman. watch part 2 worlds busiest land crossing inside singapore woodlands checkpoint (4538) the party concerned, however, will be detained until officers can determine whether there was any malicious intent, particularly to avoid clearance. in the case of this driver, officers established that his action was unintentional. traffic build-up can also arise from a breakdown on the causeway. even something as simple as passengers being too absorbed in their phones to notice it is their turn to verify their identity at the counter can cause delays. inside the immigration hall, congestion often stems from buses not picking up travellers heading to malaysia fast enough. after the drop-off point, bus drivers must make a u-turn indeparture side but could be delayed in a jam. first response team officers sometimes must implement a controlled release strategy, whereby they restrict the number of travellers entering the bus hall when it is already at capacity. we dont want problems such as a stampede, syamil said. the intensity of peak periods aside, officers may be faced with other kinds of tense situations. recently, a driver made the headlines when he was charged with taking photos of an ica officer at woodlands checkpoint, then posting the officers name and rank on facebook. the initial exchange at the checkpoint, along with the moment the traveller was detained as a wanted subject when he tried to pass through immigration control later that month, are featured in the second episode of the series. after he used his phone to arrange for a friend to collect his car, things escalated as he continued using the device in the holding room a breach of the rules, and he had been reminded of this. when told to stop, he became increasingly agitated, coming nearer one of the officers and calling him stupid. interacting with frustrated travellers is quite normal, said the officer, muhd haziq hazli. (but) the distance between him and me wasnt that far. but the officers have been trained not to give in to emotions, and the man calmed down subsequently. some travellers, however, act discreetly for other purposes. there was one, for example, who was suspected of using a fake passport. protective security team leader jocelyn lim, whose main role involves conducting secondary interviews and thorough checks, pressed him on the origins of his passport and the purpose of his visit. her questioning revealed many contradictions, which confirmed her suspicions. the man was denied entry into singapore. watch the series inside woodlands checkpoint here part 1 and part 2.",1
rules,CNA,Economy,Finance,14/11/2024 15:00,,,,"singapore the inland revenue authority of singapore (iras) has clawed back more than s$3 million (us$2.2 million) in unpaid taxes and penalties from 49 firms in the funeral industry over the past five years. this was following investigations infuneral sector and its related services - such as rites by religious practitioners, embalming and food catering - that began in 2019, iras said. to date, iras has audited and investigated 65 businesses for anomalies in tax reporting and prosecuted three undertakers in court. in the latest case in september, well-known undertaker roland tay from direct singapore funeral services & embalming was fined s$12,000 and ordered to pay a penalty of more than s$529,000 for tax offences. funeral parlours are typically family-run businesses, noted deputy director at iras investigation and forensics division ameera koh. their (funeral industry) business practices are often marked by substantial cash transactions, poor record-keeping, and weak internal controls or processes, she said. this may result in these businesses filing incorrect income tax returns and failing to register for goods and services tax (gst) on time when their taxable turnover over a 12-month period exceeds s$1 million, iras said. detailing how this may happen, the agency said family members double-hatting as bookkeepers may result in sales and expenses not being properly recorded. payment from clients - typically cash from contributions collected from family and friends - similarly may not be documented. iras has also prosecuted one religious practitioner since 2019. among the potential offences such service providers may commit is sometimes omitting the declaration of income from hongbao - or goodwill - money when it should be declared as employment income, iras said. iras is encouraging companies in the funeral sector to go digital to prevent themselves from falling afoul of the law. one business that has already made the switch is ang yew seng funeral parlour, which now opts for online bank transfers and qr code payments. the firm has also started using digital software which can be used to create invoices on the go, which has improved efficiency, said the firms funeral director ang jia jia. the company also engaged a third-party accounting firm. they help us with preparing the financial statements at year-end and as well as tax-reporting, she said, ms ang added that the accountants she engages also update her company on new rules, allowing the firm to keep up with the latest standards and ensure compliance. we also wanted to maintain a positive business reputation as well (so) we will have a good relationship with customers (and) suppliers, she said. ms ang, who has been in the family-run business for more than a decade, said the industry is slowly moving away from cash payments, partly prompted by the covid-19 pandemic two years ago, when in-person contact had to be reduced. executive director of the association of funeral directors hoo hung chye similarly said that businesses are starting to rely less on cash payments, as some families have started to collect contributions from relatives and friends digitally. mr hoo added that while there are a few bad eggs among the roughly 400 registered funeral service providers, they do not reflect the sectors quality of service. still, his association is trying to encourage firms to evolve and improve in some areas. with the help of the agencies we're trying to reach out to more and more of these funeral service providers to better professionalise themselves, he said. the association is also advising them on their statutory compliance and regulatory obligations. this, hopefully, will help the whole industry transform itself to better serve the families that we serve, he said.",1
rules,CNA,Community Behavior,Social Interactions,15/11/2024 9:57,1.3495907,103.9567879,Tampines West,"singapore the range of penalties for motorists who drive dangerously or carelessly will change if amendments road traffic act are passed. the proposed changes law, introduced into parliament on monday (nov 11), are meant to give the courts and the prosecution greater flexibility in punishing errant drivers. the ministry of home affairs (mha) is proposing three key changes to how sentences for driving offences are decided. 1. mandatory minimum punishments the courts will be given more room to reach an appropriate sentence through the removal or reduction of mandatory minimum punishments. for first-time offenders, the proposed changes will remove the mandatory minimum sentence and disqualification period for offences of dangerous or careless driving that cause death or grievous hurt. for repeat offenders, the amended law will halve the mandatory minimum jail sentences for dangerous driving causing death from four years to two years and dangerous driving causing grievous hurt from two years to one year. however, the mandatory minimum penalties will remain in place for offenders driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. the maximum punishments for these offences will also remain unchanged. 2. how the offender is charged the prosecution will be given more flexibility to proceed with an appropriate charge against the driver which takes into consideration the severity of hurt caused victim. specifically, prosecutors will be able to proceed with a charge of causing hurt and not grievous hurt, even if the victims injuries meet the legal definition of grievous hurt. grievous hurt is defined under section 320 of the penal code. it can include fractures or dislocations, and when the victim cannot follow his or her ordinary pursuits for at least 20 days. the change would better allow the prosecution to take into account the nature of the injury caused and whether other road users share responsibility for the incident. 3. repeat offenders the definition of a repeat offender will be narrowed. currently, a motorist is a repeat offender if he or she has been convicted previously of any one of the following dangerous or careless driving, conducting illegal speed trials, or speeding. if the amendments are passed, a motorist facing a dangerous or careless driving charge will be considered a repeat offender vis-a-vis his speeding convictions only if he or she mha regularly reviews singapores laws. the last time it reviewed road traffic act offences was in 2019. this time, the ministry assessed that it needed to adjust the act to better balance deterrence and proportionality, which are among the principles that courts follow when giving sentences. mha said the proposed changes make sure that behaviour that is relatively less egregious is not overly penalised, while still being able to heavily penalise egregious offenders. lawyer felicia yeo, associate at amarjit sidhu law, said the proposed changes widen the sentencing spectrum, giving the court more discretion to hand out suitable sentences depending on the offenders culpability and the harm caused. for instance, courts will be able to give lighter sentences for incidents where other road users also behaved irresponsibly. mha gave the example of a lorry driver who takes a left turn carelessly and hits a cyclist. the cyclist rode from the footpath onroad without stopping. under the road traffic rules, a cyclist who crosses a road at any place other than a pedestrian crossing should yield the right of way to all vehicles. the cyclist suffers grievous hurt from the collision a fracture and abrasions and gets three days of medical leave. under the current law, if convicted for careless driving causing grievous hurt, the lorry driver would be disqualified from driving for at least five years, as this is the mandatory minimum. if the proposed changes are passed, this minimum will be removed and the court can determine an appropriate disqualification period considering the full circumstances of the incident. lawyer adrian wee, managing partner of lighthouse law, said giving the prosecution more flexibility to proceed with the appropriate charge is likely a response to a recent high court decision. this case, cited as chen song v public prosecutor, brought together five appeals by different offenders convicted of careless driving causing hurt or grievous hurt. a decision was issued on may 14 by a panel of three judges. they found that in the specific context of the road traffic act, grievous hurt and hurt are mutually exclusive types of harm, and that the prosecution does not have the discretion to reduce a charge involving grievous hurt to one of hurt. instead, the choice of charge must be determined purely by a factual finding of the injuries suffered by the victim. this is as opposed context of the penal code, which provides for overlapping categories of hurt, and therefore, discretion to reduce a charge to reflect a lower level of harm. still, the proposed changes have led some to question whether they will more effectively deter traffic offences and make roads safer. shouldn't it be the opposite, to raise the mandatory sentences for first timers to prevent more incidents of such nature from happening? one user on social media platform reddit asked. in may, after an accident in tampines killed two people, minister of state for home affairs muhammad faishal ibrahim said that current penalties are enough to deter dangerous driving and will not be increased. lawyers told cna that the proposal to remove mandatory minimum penalties does not necessarily mean a more lenient stance towards driving offences. mr wee said the proposed amendments do not signal that sentences will be reduced. a key indicator of this is that there are no changes maximum penalties for careless and dangerous driving offences. the maximum penalties remain these maximum penalties, as well as higher penalties for repeat offenders and those driving under the influence, were introduced after mhas last review of the road traffic act in 2019. mr wee said that the proposed changes signify a more graduated and, in my opinion, fairer approach towards the prosecution of driving offences. ms yeo described the proposed changes as safeguards so that the court does not excessively punish criminal conduct that is less culpable. she said they may also serve as a reminder to road users to stay calm and continue to abide by the traffic rules and abstain from following suit when they encounter errant drivers. otherwise, these road users may have to bear the legal consequences too, she said. singapores road traffic fatality rate per 100,000 people was 2.3 in 2023. this is the highest since 2016, when the rate was 2.51. there were 131 fatal traffic accidents in 2023, higher than in 2022 and exceeding pre-covid levels in 2019. the police said there was a significant increase in the number of accidents caused by the motorists failure to keep a proper lookout or properly control the vehicle, or by changing lanes without due care. the proposed amendments also seek to strengthen enforcement powers. the powers of traffic police to suspend a motorists driving licence will be strengthened. this is to close current gaps that would allow a motorist back on the roads while he or she appeals against a conviction or while a sentence has been deferred. immigration officers will also be able to give breathalyser tests at and near border checkpoints, to promptly act against drink drivers entering singapore. mha said that shaping driver behaviour upstream is also important, and other measures have already been taken towards this. the speed enforcement function in red-light cameras has been progressively activated across singapore since april. since january, lorries with a maximum laden weight of 3,501kg to 12,000kg have had mandatory speed limiters installed to ensure they do not exceed 60kmh. the proposed legislative changes are due to be debated at the bill's second reading in parliament.",0

and wider asian shares in general - declined on monday (nov 11) after a closely-watched legislative meeting last week disappointed investors. beijing announced a 10 trillion yuan package last friday (nov 8) to help ease local government debt issues, including a six trillion yuan push to clear hidden debt. however, policymakers fell short of announcing any new growth-boosting measures for the stuttering economy. i am currently losing money, mr li admitted. even then, he blames himself, saying (its because) im not picking the leading stock. like mr li, there has been a surge in the number of chinese youths flocking stock market - a departure from their usually conservative investment practices as many look to make a quick fortune. while there isnt an official count of overall chinese youth investors, data from sinolink securities, a chengdu-based capital markets firm, shows nearly half of its new account holders since early october are under 30 years old. china-based securities firm northeast securities also told shanghai securities news, a financial newspaper owned by state-run agency xinhua, that new accounts opened during the golden week holiday period in early october tripled compared same period last year, with a significant increase in investors aged 18 to 25. shenzhen-based securities company ark of the times similarly noted an influx of new customers since late septembers policy announcements. thirty per cent of the newcomers are under 35 years old, according to founder and director wei haihong, 57. he shared that tech stocks, which align with chinas high-tech manufacturing and innovation ambitions, remain the most popular among this group. what has sparked concern is that some are borrowing money to dabble in the stock market. a client service manager from a bank of china branch in shandong who wanted to be known only as mr zhao observed a surge in loan requests compared to usual times right before golden week. there have been cases of low-interest consumer loans being used to buy shares amid the market rally, according to local media reports. this has prompted banks to caution customers that this is not sanctioned, and they risk the loans being cancelled. analysts say this is in marked contrast chinese youths previously conservative investment patterns. younger chinese, when they do have money, have been putting it into time deposits or buying gold they've been very conservative, mr shaun rein, the founder and managing director of strategic market intelligence firm china market research group (cmr), told cna, adding that focusing on these relatively more secure ventures is not a bad choice considering the deflationary pressures and property slump the country is facing. but he noted that the recent run-up in equities has been drawing them instock market, a relatively riskier venture compared to time deposits or buying gold. chinas central bank unveiled a raft of measures on sep 24 to shore up a stuttering economy. offering more funding and interest rate cuts, the broader-than-expected package was the biggest stimulus since the pandemic. the market reaction was quick and drastic. as small and big investors alike piled in, china stocks experienced their best day in 16 years on sep 30. combined turnover on the shanghai and shenzhen bourses rose to a record high of 2.6 trillion yuan. while gains have pared back, the benchmark csi 300 index is still up more than 20 per cent following the late-september moves. all of my three stock-related group chats have been buzzing, said mr wang mo, 34, an operator for a machinery spare parts supplier in wenzhou, zhejiang province who began investing a decade ago. his younger compatriots have also been swept up in the stock market buzz, with many turning to online forums for support. one such platform, taoguba, features over 170 s on post-2000 discussions. meanwhile, zhejiang universitys internal online forum is flooded with stock market posts, reflecting the keen interest of varsity students. observers warn that these newcomers could be badly burnt, especially those driven by emotion rather than knowledge. mr wang is all too familiar with risk. his investing journey began in 2014 when he was a financial manager at a chinese bank. after a rosy start where he doubled his initial 50,000 yuan investment, by 2016 he had suffered a loss of 100,000 yuan and decided to take a break. he returned market in 2019, investing in equity funds and stock indexes, hoping for another round of gains. i spent 500,000 yuan in stocks over the past decade, but compared to interest rates, im making a loss, he admitted. now, mr wang is looking to ride the wave of the latest stock market developments. but hes aware that things could go south. since late september, chinas stock markets have experienced sharp fluctuations. after an initial boost from the stimulus package announcement, stocks have swung heavily between rallies and retreats. to him, investing in chinas domestic a-shares is not just taking a chance, its a 100 per cent gamble. a-shares are the shares of mainland china-based companies that trade on the shanghai, shenzhen and beijing bourses, and use the renminbi for valuation. i am a timid person. if i had seen this situation in the past, i wouldnt be buying, but this time ive prepared 500,000 yuan, mr wang said. this is purely a gamble, short term. the gambling mentality is also something mr li, the university undergraduate, has observed among fellow investors as well. chinese investors have lower stock literacy (and have) more of a gambling mindset - they are mostly investing on sentiment, said mr li, who only began investing in late july after being introduced stock market through an inter-varsity competition. organised by a department of the communist youth league central committee, it ironically aimed to enhance students financial literacy. the market instability has shaken investor confidence, affecting both newcomers and seasoned operators. a weibo hashtag, post-2000 generations first tuition fee after entering the stock market, has garnered over 4.5 million views. the trend was sparked by a youth who entered the stock market on oct 8 and lost 200,000 yuan in just eight days. fortunes have been made in the last two weeks but you have to be very cautious because you're playing with fire, mr rein cautioned on oct 9. mr wei, the securities firm founder, observed that new investors are increasingly focused on short-term gains due to volatile fluctuations. he also noted a growing preference for the beijing stock exchange - founded in 2021 - over the shanghai and shenzhen bourses. he believes this is due to its smaller market size, greater flexibility, and the daily 30 per cent limit on share price movements in either direction. as more chinese youths embrace the stock market as an extra income source, the question of whether this could help the countrys goal of boosting domestic consumption has also come up. however, mr rein says the reality is that the stock market rally has only helped a fairly small percentage of the countrys population. he expressed concern that with chinas youth unemployment hitting 18.8 per cent in august - the highest so far for the year - and cautious spending patterns, the short-term rise in equities is unlikely to significantly boost consumer confidence and in turn encourage consumption. i think you need to have a stabilisation of income. people need to know that every month for the next three to five years, they're going to have a good job until you get stabilised income levels, you're not going to see people go out and spend, said mr rein. china has been on an all-out push to fire up its domestic consumption engines as it strives towards economic recovery amid strong headwinds, and meet its full-year growth target of around 5 per cent. according to chinas market regulator, around 220 million people invest in stocks. thats less than 20 per cent of the countrys adult population. in contrast, more than 60 per cent of adults in the us, or about 162 million americans, own stocks, according to american analytics firm gallup. mr kelvin tay, chief investment officer for south asia pacific at ubs wealth management, sees the shift in asset classes as part of a broader trend observed in other countries. traditionally, housing has been the preferred asset class for investments (in china), accounting for as much as 70 per cent of household balance sheets, he said, drawing parallels to asset shifts in japan and the us following property market downturns. in china, as the bond market doesnt have the depth and breadth as the us, the only clear asset class that investors can shift to is the equity market. investing in stocks is also relatively more affordable than the property market, as the financial outlay is much lower. however, he noted that stock rallies are unlikely to drive short-term consumption, especially with the property market being a longstanding investment vehicle in china. white goods (major appliances) and durable goods consumption will only pick up when the property market improves, he explained. at the same time, should the stock market turbulence settle and persistent gains emerge, analysts say it could hold much promise. (i see) continued sustained upticks in the stock market as an essential piece for china to catalyse the transition into a consumption-driven economy, said mr lee kok how, an affiliate lecturer at singapore management university (smu) specialising in china's business landscape. as opposed to short-term speculation, mr lee believes that cautious participation by young people in the stock market will contribute to gradual and sustained upticks, which could aid the consumption drive as they reap the dividends and potentially spend more. investments have traditionally been closely associated with retirement adequacy, as theyre seen as pivotal in growing ones nest egg. in fact, this was a key reason why mr li, the university undergraduate, decided to enter the stock market. he initially planned on carrying out value investing, referring strategy of investing in undervalued stocks for long-term gains. but hes since changed his mind as his stock values fluctuate amid the market instability. (ive been) periodically breaking even and periodically making a loss, mr li conceded. the former financial manager mr wang has ruled out investing in domestic shares long-term for retirement planning purposes. he shared that he once had confidence in the market but has gradually lost faith over the years due to continued losses brought about by what he alleged are opaque and unfair rules. (theres) no future, he remarked. mr rein from cmr said market stability is sorely needed. you can't have 8, 9 per cent swings on a daily basis - that just makes everybody scared. and this is more like a casino, he said. mr lee from smu predicts it will take some years before chinas stock market stabilises. a decade, if chinas lucky, he said. he believes the chinese government wants a gradual rally in line with market fundamentals. the (recent) regulatory tightening of securities rules aims to make the stock market more transparent, robust, and less likely for manipulators to cut chives, for lack of a better term, mr lee said. in china, the term cutting chives or ge jiu cai in chinese, is a metaphor commonly used in economic and financial contexts. it refers to a cyclical process where small investors or ordinary people are exploited for financial gain by corporations, institutions, or wealthy individuals. ubs mr tay emphasised the need for better financial literacy. while china has been taking such steps in recent years, like organising financial literacy courses in primary and secondary schools, its unclear how effective they have been. the main issue is financial education. this is where i think chinese investors have some way to go, he said. for mr li the university graduate, the deed is already done. right now, he just wants to lose as little of his 30,000 yuan stock investment as possible. he hopes his experience proves a cautionary tale for those looking to enter the market. but hes also staying positive through it all. its a small sum in the long run. im lucky i didnt start playing when i had a few million (yuan) - id probably lose it all.",1

a departure from their usually conservative investment practices as many look to make a quick fortune. while there isnt an official count of overall chinese youth investors, data from sinolink securities, a chengdu-based capital markets firm, shows nearly half of its new account holders since early october are under 30 years old. china-based securities firm northeast securities also told shanghai securities news, a financial newspaper owned by state-run agency xinhua, that new accounts opened during the golden week holiday period in early october tripled compared same period last year, with a significant increase in investors aged 18 to 25. shenzhen-based securities company ark of the times similarly noted an influx of new customers since late septembers policy announcements. thirty per cent of the newcomers are under 35 years old, according to founder and director wei haihong, 57. he shared that tech stocks, which align with chinas high-tech manufacturing and innovation ambitions, remain the most popular among this group. what has sparked concern is that some are borrowing money to dabble in the stock market. a client service manager from a bank of china branch in shandong who wanted to be known only as mr zhao observed a surge in loan requests compared to usual times right before golden week. there have been cases of low-interest consumer loans being used to buy shares amid the market rally, according to local media reports. this has prompted banks to caution customers that this is not sanctioned, and they risk the loans being cancelled. analysts say this is in marked contrast chinese youths previously conservative investment patterns. younger chinese, when they do have money, have been putting it into time deposits or buying gold they've been very conservative, mr shaun rein, the founder and managing director of strategic market intelligence firm china market research group (cmr), told cna, adding that focusing on these relatively more secure ventures is not a bad choice considering the deflationary pressures and property slump the country is facing. but he noted that the recent run-up in equities has been drawing them instock market, a relatively riskier venture compared to time deposits or buying gold. chinas central bank unveiled a raft of measures on sep 24 to shore up a stuttering economy. offering more funding and interest rate cuts, the broader-than-expected package was the biggest stimulus since the pandemic. the market reaction was quick and drastic. as small and big investors alike piled in, china stocks experienced their best day in 16 years on sep 30. combined turnover on the shanghai and shenzhen bourses rose to a record high of 2.6 trillion yuan. while gains have pared back, the benchmark csi 300 index is still up more than 20 per cent following the late-september moves. all of my three stock-related group chats have been buzzing, said mr wang mo, 34, an operator for a machinery spare parts supplier in wenzhou, zhejiang province who began investing a decade ago. his younger compatriots have also been swept up in the stock market buzz, with many turning to online forums for support. one such platform, taoguba, features over 170 s on post-2000 discussions. meanwhile, zhejiang universitys internal online forum is flooded with stock market posts, reflecting the keen interest of varsity students. observers warn that these newcomers could be badly burnt, especially those driven by emotion rather than knowledge. mr wang is all too familiar with risk. his investing journey began in 2014 when he was a financial manager at a chinese bank. after a rosy start where he doubled his initial 50,000 yuan investment, by 2016 he had suffered a loss of 100,000 yuan and decided to take a break. he returned market in 2019, investing in equity funds and stock indexes, hoping for another round of gains. i spent 500,000 yuan in stocks over the past decade, but compared to interest rates, im making a loss, he admitted. now, mr wang is looking to ride the wave of the latest stock market developments. but hes aware that things could go south. since late september, chinas stock markets have experienced sharp fluctuations. after an initial boost from the stimulus package announcement, stocks have swung heavily between rallies and retreats. to him, investing in chinas domestic a-shares is not just taking a chance, its a 100 per cent gamble. a-shares are the shares of mainland china-based companies that trade on the shanghai, shenzhen and beijing bourses, and use the renminbi for valuation. i am a timid person. if i had seen this situation in the past, i wouldnt be buying, but this time ive prepared 500,000 yuan, mr wang said. this is purely a gamble, short term. the gambling mentality is also something mr li, the university undergraduate, has observed among fellow investors as well. chinese investors have lower stock literacy (and have) more of a gambling mindset - they are mostly investing on sentiment, said mr li, who only began investing in late july after being introduced stock market through an inter-varsity competition. organised by a department of the communist youth league central committee, it ironically aimed to enhance students financial literacy. the market instability has shaken investor confidence, affecting both newcomers and seasoned operators. a weibo hashtag, post-2000 generations first tuition fee after entering the stock market, has garnered over 4.5 million views. the trend was sparked by a youth who entered the stock market on oct 8 and lost 200,000 yuan in just eight days. fortunes have been made in the last two weeks but you have to be very cautious because you're playing with fire, mr rein cautioned on oct 9. mr wei, the securities firm founder, observed that new investors are increasingly focused on short-term gains due to volatile fluctuations. he also noted a growing preference for the beijing stock exchange - founded in 2021 - over the shanghai and shenzhen bourses. he believes this is due to its smaller market size, greater flexibility, and the daily 30 per cent limit on share price movements in either direction. as more chinese youths embrace the stock market as an extra income source, the question of whether this could help the countrys goal of boosting domestic consumption has also come up. however, mr rein says the reality is that the stock market rally has only helped a fairly small percentage of the countrys population. he expressed concern that with chinas youth unemployment hitting 18.8 per cent in august - the highest so far for the year - and cautious spending patterns, the short-term rise in equities is unlikely to significantly boost consumer confidence and in turn encourage consumption. i think you need to have a stabilisation of income. people need to know that every month for the next three to five years, they're going to have a good job until you get stabilised income levels, you're not going to see people go out and spend, said mr rein. china has been on an all-out push to fire up its domestic consumption engines as it strives towards economic recovery amid strong headwinds, and meet its full-year growth target of around 5 per cent. according to chinas market regulator, around 220 million people invest in stocks. thats less than 20 per cent of the countrys adult population. in contrast, more than 60 per cent of adults in the us, or about 162 million americans, own stocks, according to american analytics firm gallup. mr kelvin tay, chief investment officer for south asia pacific at ubs wealth management, sees the shift in asset classes as part of a broader trend observed in other countries. traditionally, housing has been the preferred asset class for investments (in china), accounting for as much as 70 per cent of household balance sheets, he said, drawing parallels to asset shifts in japan and the us following property market downturns. in china, as the bond market doesnt have the depth and breadth as the us, the only clear asset class that investors can shift to is the equity market. investing in stocks is also relatively more affordable than the property market, as the financial outlay is much lower. however, he noted that stock rallies are unlikely to drive short-term consumption, especially with the property market being a longstanding investment vehicle in china. white goods (major appliances) and durable goods consumption will only pick up when the property market improves, he explained. at the same time, should the stock market turbulence settle and persistent gains emerge, analysts say it could hold much promise. (i see) continued sustained upticks in the stock market as an essential piece for china to catalyse the transition into a consumption-driven economy, said mr lee kok how, an affiliate lecturer at singapore management university (smu) specialising in china's business landscape. as opposed to short-term speculation, mr lee believes that cautious participation by young people in the stock market will contribute to gradual and sustained upticks, which could aid the consumption drive as they reap the dividends and potentially spend more. investments have traditionally been closely associated with retirement adequacy, as theyre seen as pivotal in growing ones nest egg. in fact, this was a key reason why mr li, the university undergraduate, decided to enter the stock market. he initially planned on carrying out value investing, referring strategy of investing in undervalued stocks for long-term gains. but hes since changed his mind as his stock values fluctuate amid the market instability. (ive been) periodically breaking even and periodically making a loss, mr li conceded. the former financial manager mr wang has ruled out investing in domestic shares long-term for retirement planning purposes. he shared that he once had confidence in the market but has gradually lost faith over the years due to continued losses brought about by what he alleged are opaque and unfair rules. (theres) no future, he remarked. mr rein from cmr said market stability is sorely needed. you can't have 8, 9 per cent swings on a daily basis - that just makes everybody scared. and this is more like a casino, he said. mr lee from smu predicts it will take some years before chinas stock market stabilises. a decade, if chinas lucky, he said. he believes the chinese government wants a gradual rally in line with market fundamentals. the (recent) regulatory tightening of securities rules aims to make the stock market more transparent, robust, and less likely for manipulators to cut chives, for lack of a better term, mr lee said. in china, the term cutting chives or ge jiu cai in chinese, is a metaphor commonly used in economic and financial contexts. it refers to a cyclical process where small investors or ordinary people are exploited for financial gain by corporations, institutions, or wealthy individuals. ubs mr tay emphasised the need for better financial literacy. while china has been taking such steps in recent years, like organising financial literacy courses in primary and secondary schools, its unclear how effective they have been. the main issue is financial education. this is where i think chinese investors have some way to go, he said. for mr li the university graduate, the deed is already done. right now, he just wants to lose as little of his 30,000 yuan stock investment as possible. he hopes his experience proves a cautionary tale for those looking to enter the market. but hes also staying positive through it all. its a small sum in the long run. im lucky i didnt start playing when i had a few million (yuan) - id probably lose it all.",1

(we need) to be prepared to adjust our strategy even as the global environment evolves, he said. a commemorative sculpture was unveiled to mark the 20th edition of the jcbc. the 3d-printed resin sculpture is designed to resemble the numbers 2 and 0 when viewed from different angles, symbolising the two decades of collaboration between singapore and china. bilateral financial cooperation will get a boost with several green finance and capital markets initiatives. one tie-up between the singapore and china central banks aims to catalyse green financing flows. the exercise, which compares the green criteria of the european union, china and singapore taxonomies, will be completed by the end of this year, the monetary authority of singapore said in a press release on monday. this will enable easier comparison of the green taxonomies of singapore and china and facilitate the provision of cross-border green loans, green bond issuance and fund investments. mas and the peoples bank of china are also exploring a pilot with both countries banks to enhance international investors access to chinas bond market. it will leverage the existing over-the-counter bond market framework in china. other collaborations include discussions to expand the suite of products on the exchange traded funds (etf) product links between the singapore exchange and the shenzhen and shanghai bourses, as well as facilitating financial institutions access to singapore and china markets. in trade, singapore and china reiterated their commitment china-singapore free trade agreement (csfta) further upgrade protocol, which is set to enter into force on dec 31, 2024, said singapores ministry of trade and industry (mti) in a separate press release. the csfta is chinas first comprehensive bilateral free trade agreement with an asian country. it came into force in 2009, and the latest planned enhancements were inked at last years jcbc. under them, singapore investors and service suppliers can expect more liberal and transparent rules that level the playing field for them to invest in and trade with china, mti said. the ministry added that singapore businesses will also benefit from greater market access to china through a negative list approach, where by default, all sectors are opened to investors except for those specifically listed. notably, china commits to not limiting foreign equity limits for singapore investors in 22 sectors such as construction, retailing & wholesale, and architectural & urban planning services, mti said. another agreement focuses on the joint promotion of the belt and road initiative. it aims to strengthen singapore and chinas collaboration in areas such as policy coordination, infrastructure connectivity, bilateral trade and people-to-people exchanges. (this) will provide clearer policy guidance for the next phase of high-quality belt and road development, further promoting the joint growth of china, singapore, and regional countries, said mr ding. since 2013, singapore has been chinas largest foreign investor in terms of investment flows, and china has been singapores largest merchandise trading partner. bilateral trade in 2023 amounted to us$108.39 billion, according to chinas foreign ministry. on maritime cooperation, both countries are aiming to elevate cooperation on their green and digital shipping corridor (gdsc) initiatives national level. this will deepen cooperation and strengthen coordination between the maritime industries of both countries (and) will also align efforts on decarbonisation, digitalisation, and workforce development, mti said. singapore and china currently have two gdsc agreements. the singapore-shandong tie-up was announced in october, while the singapore-tianjin collaboration was established last year. it aims to drive the adoption of green and digital solutions and the growth of the maritime industry between singapore and the bohai and yellow sea region, mti noted regarding the singapore-shandong gdsc. as part of this, the maritime and port authority of singapore and the shandong provincial transport department will work with various stakeholders - including maritime companies, port operators and institutes of higher learning - to promote digital and low-carbon initiatives for shipping. these include exploring tie-ups in areas like emerging technologies, alternative fuels and shore power technologies. suzhou industrial park - the first government-to-government project between singapore and china - also took the limelight on monday. the project is marking its 30th anniversary this year. singapore leaders have over the years referred to suzhou industrial park as a pathfinder for bilateral cooperation. this point was reiterated during the jcbc meeting. i am heartened that 30 years after its establishment, (suzhou industrial park) remains a frontrunner of chinas economic development, said mr gan. he added that the projects focus on the green economy and biomedical sciences is closely aligned with both countries priorities. both sides are finalising a 10-year blueprint to chart the next phase of development for the project, shared mr chan chun sing, the singapore minister-in-charge of suzhou industrial park. (this is to position suzhou industrial park) as a pioneer in the development of sustainable industrial parks, a gateway for two-way internationalisation, a bridge for joint innovation, and a platform to deepen people-to-people exchanges, he shared. through the sip (suzhou industrial park), singapore and china can work side by side on pressing global priorities, from tackling global carbon emissions and climate change, to addressing healthcare needs of an ageing population, and contribute to a brighter future for both our countries and the world. a persimmon tree was planted at the singapore botanic gardens by the jcbc co-chairs mr gan and mr ding on nov 10, to mark the 30th anniversary of suzhou industrial park. a persimmon tree will also be planted in sip during a commemorative event at the end of the month. mr dings visit to singapore from sunday to monday was his first as chinese vice premier and jcbc co-chair. while in town, he also met with singapore leaders, including president tharman shanmugaratnam, prime minister lawrence wong, and senior minister teo chee hean. the leaders of both sides reaffirmed the longstanding and substantive relations between singapore and china, and discussed ways to further deepen bilateral ties, singapores foreign affairs ministry said in a press release on monday. they also exchanged views on regional and international issues, including challenges facing the global economy. mr wong said he was delighted to welcome mr ding to singapore. bilateral ties are in excellent shape, with both sides exploring new possibilities for cooperation, he wrote in a facebook post on monday afternoon. we look forward to a closer and stronger partnership with china, as we celebrate the 35th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year, pm wong said.",1

(mr prabowo) said the regional elections are supposed to be neutral but he endorses ahmad luthfi-taj yasin instead, a netizen posted on x on sunday. responding concerns, mr hasan nasbi, head of the presidential communications office, clarified that mr prabowos endorsement did not breach election rules. as the general chairman of the gerindra party, mr prabowo is entitled to offer recommendations and support regional head candidates that are backed by his party, he told local media on sunday, as quoted by detik. mr hasan added that state officials such as the president who belong to political parties are also allowed to express support for regional-head candidates. the neutrality rule only applies indonesian national armed forces (tni), national police (polri) and the state civil servants (asn). ministers, especially those from political parties, can endorse candidates and can even campaign, he was quoted as saying by kompas. mr prabowos endorsement of regional election candidates is believed to be unprecedented. indonesia began holding regional elections in 2005 when mr susilo bambang yudhoyono was president, and simultaneous regional elections began in 2015 when mr joko widodo was president. mr prabowo appears to have endorsed other candidates contesting in the nov 27 elections. over the weekend, jakarta gubernatorial candidate ridwan kamil said mr prabowo has endorsed his campaign. the governors that are backed by mr prabowo subianto are the ridwan kamil-suswono pair, mr ridwan said on sunday, as quoted by kompas. earlier this month, mr prabowo had also uploaded pictures of himself and mr ridwan having dinner amid reports that some coalition politicians have aligned themselves with mr ridwans rival, mr pramono anung of the pdi-p. during a lunch event in denpasar, bali on nov 3, mr prabowo expressed support for balis candidate pair of mr made muliawan and mr putu agus suradnyana from his coalition. although the event was only attended by the governor and mayoral candidates that his gerindra party is endorsing, videos of him making the statement linked to his commitment to build a north bali international airport have circulated on social media.",1

rules,CNA,Environment,Sustainable Living,11/11/2024 17:26,1.3612182,103.8862529,Kovan,"singapore it is not useful to compare the three most recent oil spill incidents in singapore, as they are of very different natures, minister of state for transport murali pillai said on monday (nov 11). mr murali was responding to questions by members of parliament about oil spill and leak incidents on jun 14, oct 20 and oct 28 this year. at least eight mps from both sides of the house filed questions, asking about the underlying causes of the incidents, response times, environmental impact, and mitigation measures against re-occurrences. in response, mr murali, who is also minister of state for law, stressed that the nature and scale of each incident was different, with the cause of each incident unrelated others. the jun 14 incident, which led to beaches around singapore being closed, was due to an allision between a dredger - vox maxima - and a bunker tanker - marine honour - at pasir panjang terminal, resulting in a discharge of around 400 tonnes of oil insea. allision refers to when a moving vessel hits a stationary object. the maritime and port authority of singapore (mpa) has completed its investigations and assessed that key crew members of netherlands-flagged vox maxima failed to discharge their duties properly, said mr murali. the four men were charged in the state courts on nov 6 under the merchant shipping act 1995. the oct 20 incident was a result of a leak in shells land-based pipeline at bukom, leading to about 30 to 40 tonnes of slop - a mixture of oil and water - leaking insea. the oct 28 incident was due to an overflow of bunker fuel in the receiving vessel during a bunkering operation off changi. as a result, about 5 tonnes of oil overflowed insea, which mr murali noted was a much smaller amount compared jun 14 incident. given the very different natures, scales and locations of the three incidents, the time and resources required to monitor, clean up and mitigate the spread of oil from these three incidents were different. it is therefore not as useful to compare the response times for these incidents, said mr murali. once it became aware of the incident, mpa coordinated with other agencies such as the national environment agency (nea), national parks board (nparks), singapore's national water agency pub to activate resources and capabilities to respond. for the incidents in october, the agencies activated an emergency operations team which implemented precautionary measures to monitor and prevent the further spread of oil. these include the activation of craft to spray dispersants, and the installation of oil absorbent booms to protect beaches and biodiversity sensitive areas. for the oil leak on oct 20, shell activated resources to clean up the leaked slop in the channel between pulau bukom and pulau bukom kechil, with operations completed nine days later, mr murali said. agencies have stood down seaward oil response assets and the booms that were earlier deployed as no other oil sightings at sea and ashore have arisen from these incidents, he added. responding to mp dennis tan's (wp-hougang) query on the timeline for the discovery of the oil leak, mr murali said that the leak in shell's pipeline reportedly occurred at around 5.30am on oct 20. shell alerted mpa at around 1pm. mpa then alerted nea shortly after. mr murali said that nea and mpa are investigating the incident, including the time taken before shell notified the agencies. according rules, shell is supposed to inform mpa and nea as soon as possible when they detected the leak. if there are lapses by shell, the agencies will take the necessary enforcement actions against the company, he added. senior minister of state for sustainability and the environment amy khor also addressed briefly nea's investigation inmatter in response to a separate question filed by ncmp hazel poa (psp). ms poa asked if the government would be checking the structural integrity of all oil pipelines in singapores waters. dr khor replied that nea was reviewing the measures that shell has in place at its facility. as an interim measure, nea has directed shell to carry out a comprehensive pipeline integrity check across their bukom plant, she said. addressing questions about alert and monitoring systems in place, mr murali said involved parties are required under the law to notify the authorities immediately when there is a discharge of oil into water or on land. mpa has a surveillance system to identify and monitor oil sightings, including regular patrols by mpa patrol craft, he said. the agency also informs agencies to be on standby to deploy resources to prevent further pollution or facilitate clean-up operations for seaward spills. in a supplementary question, mr tan asked what regular checks owners of oil pipelines had to conduct to ensure the integrity of all pipelines. how does mpa ensure that these inspections and checks are carried out so that repairs and maintenance can be carried out in advance of (oil leakages)? asked mr tan. he also asked if there were plans to improve response times from mpa's oil spill response contractor. mr murali clarified that nea would be responsible for checks of land-based pipelines, as was the case for the shell incident. he added that the relevant agencies will work with industry players to minimise the risk of oil spills, including a contingency plan which is rehearsed and refined regularly. the authorities have an inter-agency exercise for oil spills every two years. it is important for us to recognise that every oil spill incident is different as there are a variety of external factors, such as tidal and current conditions, the location of the incident and the time of the incident. some tailoring of our response to each incident will be needed, he said. to queries on the environmental impact of the incidents, mr murali said that nparks has not observed any immediate impact on marine and coastal ecosystems and wildlife. the singapore food agency also has not observed any immediate impact on fisheries. no oil from the october incidents has landed on any of our recreational beaches. pub is also monitoring the seawater intakes at its desalination plants, and readings remain normal, said mr murali. in a supplementary question, mp cheryl chan (pap-east coast) asked if an environmental impact study will be conducted for every oil spill, and how long each monitoring period will be. mr murali replied after every oil spill, every incident, there will be a study to see what are the lessons that can be drawn. and then we look to see how we can improve our plans that (are) in place as well, and also engage the respective stakeholders.",1

pasir panjang terminal, resulting in a discharge of around 400 tonnes of oil insea. allision refers to when a moving vessel hits a stationary object. the maritime and port authority of singapore (mpa) has completed its investigations and assessed that key crew members of netherlands-flagged vox maxima failed to discharge their duties properly, said mr murali. the four men were charged in the state courts on nov 6 under the merchant shipping act 1995. the oct 20 incident was a result of a leak in shells land-based pipeline at bukom, leading to about 30 to 40 tonnes of slop - a mixture of oil and water - leaking insea. the oct 28 incident was due to an overflow of bunker fuel in the receiving vessel during a bunkering operation off changi. as a result, about 5 tonnes of oil overflowed insea, which mr murali noted was a much smaller amount compared jun 14 incident. given the very different natures, scales and locations of the three incidents, the time and resources required to monitor, clean up and mitigate the spread of oil from these three incidents were different. it is therefore not as useful to compare the response times for these incidents, said mr murali. once it became aware of the incident, mpa coordinated with other agencies such as the national environment agency (nea), national parks board (nparks), singapore's national water agency pub to activate resources and capabilities to respond. for the incidents in october, the agencies activated an emergency operations team which implemented precautionary measures to monitor and prevent the further spread of oil. these include the activation of craft to spray dispersants, and the installation of oil absorbent booms to protect beaches and biodiversity sensitive areas. for the oil leak on oct 20, shell activated resources to clean up the leaked slop in the channel between pulau bukom and pulau bukom kechil, with operations completed nine days later, mr murali said. agencies have stood down seaward oil response assets and the booms that were earlier deployed as no other oil sightings at sea and ashore have arisen from these incidents, he added. responding to mp dennis tan's (wp-hougang) query on the timeline for the discovery of the oil leak, mr murali said that the leak in shell's pipeline reportedly occurred at around 5.30am on oct 20. shell alerted mpa at around 1pm. mpa then alerted nea shortly after. mr murali said that nea and mpa are investigating the incident, including the time taken before shell notified the agencies. according rules, shell is supposed to inform mpa and nea as soon as possible when they detected the leak. if there are lapses by shell, the agencies will take the necessary enforcement actions against the company, he added. senior minister of state for sustainability and the environment amy khor also addressed briefly nea's investigation inmatter in response to a separate question filed by ncmp hazel poa (psp). ms poa asked if the government would be checking the structural integrity of all oil pipelines in singapores waters. dr khor replied that nea was reviewing the measures that shell has in place at its facility. as an interim measure, nea has directed shell to carry out a comprehensive pipeline integrity check across their bukom plant, she said. addressing questions about alert and monitoring systems in place, mr murali said involved parties are required under the law to notify the authorities immediately when there is a discharge of oil into water or on land. mpa has a surveillance system to identify and monitor oil sightings, including regular patrols by mpa patrol craft, he said. the agency also informs agencies to be on standby to deploy resources to prevent further pollution or facilitate clean-up operations for seaward spills. in a supplementary question, mr tan asked what regular checks owners of oil pipelines had to conduct to ensure the integrity of all pipelines. how does mpa ensure that these inspections and checks are carried out so that repairs and maintenance can be carried out in advance of (oil leakages)? asked mr tan. he also asked if there were plans to improve response times from mpa's oil spill response contractor. mr murali clarified that nea would be responsible for checks of land-based pipelines, as was the case for the shell incident. he added that the relevant agencies will work with industry players to minimise the risk of oil spills, including a contingency plan which is rehearsed and refined regularly. the authorities have an inter-agency exercise for oil spills every two years. it is important for us to recognise that every oil spill incident is different as there are a variety of external factors, such as tidal and current conditions, the location of the incident and the time of the incident. some tailoring of our response to each incident will be needed, he said. to queries on the environmental impact of the incidents, mr murali said that nparks has not observed any immediate impact on marine and coastal ecosystems and wildlife. the singapore food agency also has not observed any immediate impact on fisheries. no oil from the october incidents has landed on any of our recreational beaches. pub is also monitoring the seawater intakes at its desalination plants, and readings remain normal, said mr murali. in a supplementary question, mp cheryl chan (pap-east coast) asked if an environmental impact study will be conducted for every oil spill, and how long each monitoring period will be. mr murali replied after every oil spill, every incident, there will be a study to see what are the lessons that can be drawn. and then we look to see how we can improve our plans that (are) in place as well, and also engage the respective stakeholders.",1

rules,CNA,Technology,Artificial Intelligence,11/8/2024 18:42,1.3295034,103.8982716,Ubi,"singapore the world has been hyper focused on training artificial intelligence data models and how laws surrounding the technology are written, said the united states first science envoy for ai on thursday (nov 7) on the other hand, attention to testing ai for security and safety, as well as how laws can be enforced, is lacking, said dr rumman chowdhury. testing is important to create a product that is useful, she told cna's yasmin jonkers in a wide-ranging interview. whether you are a government, a private entity (or) a startup, you need to do the appropriate testing. otherwise, we cannot feel comfortable putting this product out in the world, she said. she added that enforceability of laws is an area jurisdictions have been struggling with in the tech space since the emergence of social media companies. she noted that fining such companies for transgressions may not be effective because they have funds at their disposal. preventing their use would also not be an ideal situation as citizens would be upset, she added. that enforceability (and) accountability mechanisms are worth negotiating and understanding, as much as the development of the laws, rules and policies, she said. usually, people have been hyper focused on what are the laws we write and how we write them and there's not enough focus on how we can actually enforce these laws, she said. however, she added that ai is not the first industry to grapple with the idea of fair and responsible use, noting that other sectors like banking and healthcare also deal with these issues. governments already have structures in place that could be applicable, she added. i do think that it (ai) is such a confusing technology (because it is all-encompassing) and frankly, it's one of the first times we face a technology that seems better or smarter than us. things will be daunting and intimidating, but we have successfully created structures like this before, and i'm confident we'll be able to do it again. other aspects of ai that need to be discussed are bias and discrimination, said dr chowdhury. i think what's quite important for a lot of people is to understand that this technology will not be as ubiquitous as we think it is, unless we deal with kitchen table issues like bias and discrimination, said the data scientist who runs an organisation providing ethical ai solutions. she noted that ai models are trained on the data of the internet, which is the data of the western world. thinking through applications in asia will require us thinking through what the data and the sources and the biases are that could be very western-focused, or just not appropriate for use in this region, she said. what we're trying to build ai models for, for example, is improving agricultural techniques. what will happen if these models are producing biased output because they dont understand the crops in the region or the language that's being spoken? she added that the priorities that are being pushed forwards globally surrounding standards and use cases are largely driven by only a few countries. this means that solutions to improve crop yields because of climate, for instance, are not top of mind. dr chowdhury noted that these are problems faced by farmers in nations that do not have a seat at the same table, such as bangladesh - where her family is originally from - and vietnam. it's really critical that we focus on what is useful for people and the rest of us broadband access, connectivity, mobile access, all of these things are important in a population being engaged in the ai future, she said. funding is largely coming from industry, which in turn puts it in the position of agenda setter, noted dr chowdhury. she added that philanthropies need to play a bigger role. amid the rapid evolution of ai that has emerged as a challenge for even major financial institutions, the world is experiencing a scarcity in technology talent, drew propson, head of technology and innovation in financial services at the world economic forum said in a separate interview with cnas olivia marzuki. speaking on the sidelines of the singapore fintech festival on thursday, propson noted that new tools are being developed every day, and knowing whether to use them or to build a product in-house can be a dilemma. you need to then have a large talent pool that can help you with those analyses of the new tools, and be thoughtful about what you're building yourself, she said. partnership among the public and private sectors and academic institutions is key to building a large talent pool, which will ultimately make the financial system stronger, she added. the foundation to creating a generation of competent ai practitioners is working towards an empathetic and understanding society, said dr chowdhury. too often, technology is focused on building optimisation in a bubble without taking into account that the real world is a beautifully messy place, she said. as we think about what educational programmes are needed, how can we build more ethics into computer science education, more computer science into these social sciences, and really merge the two? she asked. what we need is people collaborating across disciplines and respecting each other's disciplines to understand how to drive value for this technology, for human beings as a whole. dr chowdhury added however that there is a long way to go to get value for everybody. it requires a lot of intentional development and building things like government investment inright kinds of startups, the right kinds of companies, she said.",1
rules,CNA,Community Behavior,Public Spaces,11/8/2024 11:17,1.3295034,103.8982716,Ubi,"singapore an older woman preparing to rest for the night at a brightly lit study area of a local university. an elderly man hunched over a hawker centre table, fast asleep in the middle of the night. the idea of homelessness and rough sleeping seems at odds with singapores image as a prosperous, orderly society. yet, while not a common sight, there are several hundred homeless people in singapore who sleep at park benches, void decks, stairwells, carparks and hawker centres. the issue was brought fore during the pandemic, when street counts from 2019 to 2021 revealed about 1,000 people sleeping rough in singapore. singapore's rough sleeping population has since shrunk by about 40 per cent to 530 people, as of 2022. but this still means that for every 100,000 people in singapore, about nine are sleeping rough. the irony about the homelessness issue is that often it is not just about giving people a roof over their heads. housing is a critical piece of the solution but tackling homelessness requires meeting complex physiological, emotional and social needs. singapore has taken several strides forward to tackle homelessness since the pandemic. regular nationwide street counts of rough sleepers are now conducted to understand the extent and reasons behind rough sleeping. the peers network, a collaboration between community groups, social service agencies and government organisations, has been proactively befriending rough sleepers through night walks, to offer shelter and assistance. the housing and development board has also piloted new public rental housing typologies to better support singles, including rough sleepers, who face difficulty in finding co-tenants or living with others. the joint singles scheme operator-run pilot allows for singles to apply for a rental flat without having to find a flatmate, while the single room shared facilities pilot provides tenants with greater privacy with their own bedrooms, alongside access to shared facilities to prevent social isolation. such innovative mindset could also apply to singapores homeless shelters. currently, homeless people here have access to two main shelter options safe sound sleeping places (s3ps), which are temporary or overnight shelters run by community or religious organisations, and the longer-term government-funded transitional shelters in one-room to three-room hdb flats or former public buildings. according to an update from senior parliamentary secretary for social and family development eric chua in parliament last month, about 60 per cent of the 720 beds available at singapores seven transitional shelters were occupied yearly from 2021 to 2023. individuals stay in a transitional shelter for an average of about nine months, he added. both s3ps and transitional shelters are communal spaces that provide basic amenities and tend to be sparsely furnished. conventional wisdom on homeless shelters argues that making the space too homely could hinder a persons progress towards permanent housing. this logic seems sound. a shelter is, after all, a transitional space and should make people want to move out and into more permanent housing. such assumptions, however, lack evidence. uncomfortable shelters do not necessarily provide the impetus for people to move on. historically, in the united kingdom, homeless people had chosen to remain in overcrowded shelters that were filthy, with poor sanitation because they had no other means of supporting themselves. that said, recent research in the uk, united states, denmark and the netherlands suggest that physical spaces do matter to people living in shelters. homeless shelters can either encourage or inhibit homeless peoples recovery and their ability to regain their autonomy. physical spaces affect peoples moods and behaviour. so shelters can influence how residents see themselves and the world around them. a cramped shelter with no privacy, sterile corridors, and bare-walled rooms is hardly inviting to anyone and reinforces the stigma around homelessness. incorporating warm lighting, plants and cozy colours inshelter environment conveys the idea that you deserve a place to call home. this mindset can help the residents progress towards attaining stability. in 2023, cna reported on a prototype room for migrant workers that was designed to feel like a home, suggesting that this could be the future for dormitories. we extend the same idea to homeless shelters and suggest that designing innovative shelters that feel like home could help to keep people off the streets in singapore. shelter operators such as new hope community services and catholic welfare services are already embracing this shift. for example, transit point margaret drive (tpmd), recently underwent significant improvements, with careful consideration of colours to liven residents moods. walls were removed to improve ventilation and accessibility, and designated spaces for drying clothes were also carved out so that residents were not enveloped in the smell of musty clothing when they sat in common areas. gone, too, were the dingy toilets that would put anyone on edge. catholic welfare services also redesigned the bethlehem shelter in 2023 based on insights gained from years of outreach work. now, what greets residents in bethlehems common area are furniture and items ubiquitous in a home - a glass dining table, a cozy couch corner, paintings on freshly painted walls, and rattan dividers to provide some privacy in shared bedrooms. it is without a doubt, homelessness comes with bouts of trauma and loss of dignity. so shelters for the homeless in singapore need to provide a conducive environment for the residents to regain stability and make decisions that will help them progress in life. beyond physical spaces, social innovations can empower and uplift homeless people, promoting dignity in their recovery and housing process. the institute of policy studies recently embarked on a research project with catholic welfare services to study how decentralised decision-making can be implemented in homeless shelters. the project empowers residents to make joint decisions on house rules, shelter programmes and usage of shared facilities. by fostering greater autonomy and collaboration, shelters can prepare homeless people for the next phase of their lives in more permanent housing. self-management also develops interpersonal and soft skills such as conflict resolution and effective communication. similarly, as new hope community services prepares to move one of its transitional shelters to a new site, residents were invited to share their hopes for the new shelter. this included the kind of furniture they would like to have. they could also vote on the look and feel of the rooms based on different designs, materials and colour schemes. residents daily routines and priorities were discussed with the facilitators, so that the space could also incorporate designs to meet the residents' practical needs. there are no simple solutions to homelessness. while it is not possible to eradicate homelessness altogether, designing innovative shelters to be more homely and to promote dignity can aid recovery. to be sure, such shelters are not the answer to homelessness. permanent housing is. but shelters can effectively facilitate the move onto permanent housing, and the physical and social innovations put forth in this commentary may just provide the solutions to encourage more rough sleepers off the streets. dr harry tan is a research fellow in the policy lab at the institute of policy studies. vanessa lim is a social worker and research analyst at new hope community services. belle phang is a year 6 student at acs (independent), who previously interned at the institute of policy studies. brian monteiro is manager for

spotting a gap between what was taught in university and what the industry was looking for, mr pranjal dubey, mr a. m. aditya and mr desmond sek decided to launch xaltius academy in singapore in 2017 to offer training in data science, software engineering, cybersecurity and generative artificial intelligence (ai). mr pranjal and mr aditya are indian citizens while mr sek is singaporean. four years ago, they sought to expand abroad and decided to head to dubai, a cosmopolitan emirate of the united arab emirates (uae) in the middle east. dubai is a place where the government is also pushing a lot of initiatives in terms of upskilling and reskilling its a good market, said mr pranjal, 35. attracting and training talent for jobs enabled by ai is one of the aims of the uaes national strategy for ai 2031. xaltius co-founders also saw how its government was driving digital transformation and attracting more talent and companies, such as through a golden visa long-term residence scheme. the golden visa is awarded for either five or 10 years and is open to investors, entrepreneurs and those with specialised skills, such as doctors and scientists. while mr pranjal feels singapores business processes are more streamlined and that the city-state has a more systematic approach to doing things, dubai is more global as compared to singapore. because of its geographical location, its kind of in the centre (of the world), he said. the uae, one of the middle eastern countries banking on ai to diversify their economies from oil, has also kept a neutral stance in the ai race between the united states and china, he noted. the us has sought to curb chinas access to high-end chips and other advanced technologies that could help it develop critical technologies for a military edge. while the big-power rivalry has had no impact on xaltius, mr pranjal said being a training company, we always target places or regions which are kind of neutral. drawn to a business-friendly environment and opportunities in sectors like finance, healthcare and education, more southeast asian tech firms are heading uae and other middle eastern countries. over two dozen southeast asian tech firms have expanded middle east, with fintech firms such as singapore-headquartered ant international, which is part of chinese fintech giant ant group, leading the way, the media and events platform tech in asia reported in july. the uae, saudi arabia and qatar, in particular, have demonstrated strong commitment towards the development and implementation of ai technologies, according to professional services firm pwc. it expects ai to add us$320 billion middle easts economy by 2030, with saudi arabia and the uae to see the largest gains of us$135.2 billion (12.4 per cent of gross domestic product) and us$96 billion (13.6 per cent of gdp), respectively. southeast asian firms and other tech start-ups in the uae say it is easy to start a company there, and the country offers good infrastructure and generous financial support. the uaes golden and other visas to draw talented individuals and their families are attractive, they add. after setting up its singapore headquarters in march this year, ai solutions start-up dyna.ai opened in the uae about two months ago, said its chairman tomas skoumal, 49, who is czech. the ease of setting up the company in dubai was almost the same, he said. the middle east is one of the three regions the company is focusing on, besides southeast asia and latin america. this is because spanish and arabic are among the worlds most widely spoken languages, while southeast asia is where dyna.ais headquarters sit, he explained. dyna.ais ai platform comprises multiple large language models and text-to-speech models that are trained for financial institutions but are also applicable to other businesses. mr skoumal, who spent over two decades in banking, believes ai-driven communications will help financial and other institutions serve their customers better, faster and with more relevant products in the near future. because (the platform) can do not only communication. we also do the evaluation of the customer, risk evaluation, anti-fraud evaluation, propensity to buy, sensitivity to price, he said. customers would not need to repeat themselves when they try to resolve issues, as ai will remember what they said previously, he added. dyna.ai participated in expand north star, a major event for start-ups and investors in dubai last month, and mr skoumal said it is in talks with quite a few banks as well as potential customers from other industries. the banks are saying wow. they like it, but then obviously when we discuss how to implement it, we have to test it, he said. because banks are very rigid, they are very slow because they have to be regulators are forcing them to be. malaysian analytics firm the decision labs also participated in expand north star, with costs covered by an abu dhabi-based startup accelerator. the decision labs founder and chief executive anupam chatterjee, 43, opened a company in dubai earlier this year because he wanted to explore opportunities in the uae, saudi arabia and qatar. the decision labs offers healthcare providers platforms for digital patient feedback, real-time complaint management and query management, and already has clients in malaysia, the philippines, indonesia, vietnam, oman and bahrain. it uses ai for scenario simulation, issue categorisation and workflow generation, and pre-emptive triggers quality manager if an abnormal number of complaints in a certain category or a pattern is observed. in dubai, it works with a local partner that has experience with hospitals and the health authorities of dubai and abu dhabi, the latter being the uaes capital and largest emirate. its good to have experienced partners in the region, he said. i think both in southeast asia and middle east, theres a huge amount of trust and personal relationships which matter. after presenting at a conference in abu dhabi in may, the decision labs was invited to try for a place in a biotech and life sciences start-up programme called healthx. it succeeded and gained connections to local hospitals. there is a lot of growth and investment happening in saudi arabia, in uae and in qatar. the entire digital transformation, especially in healthcare, is happening as we are speaking, said mr anupam. for instance, he was recently encouraged during a private discussion with an official at a uae government institution to set up a biotechnology company, and understood that there were investors ready to finance it. they are ready to onboard the best talents, be it from singapore, from the us, the uk, from the top universities, said mr anupam, who is an indian citizen and in dubai on a general manager visa. he is trained in quantitative economics and has a master of business administration from hec paris and mit sloan school of management. his team currently consists of about 18 people in bangalore, malaysia and the philippines, and he plans to hire his first employee in the uae when the decision labs officially signs on a project there. singapore and dubai have been described as competitors by some observers, given their status as aviation hubs, financial centres, gateways to their respective regions and their ambition to be tech and start-up hubs. but others beg to differ. they are so geographically far away that i don't think they should be competitors, said mr skoumal of the two cities, which are a seven-and-a-half-hour flight apart. they don't fight for the same customers. they don't fight for the same companies. they have their own markets, said mr skoumal. i feel like they can learn from each other, and i guess they are doing it, he said, citing both cities efforts to digitalise government systems. dubai residents may access 280 services offered by government and private entities on the governments dubainow app, which has an ai digital concierge to help with queries. the digital dubai authority has adopted ai in myriad ways, from identifying employee development opportunities to tender evaluation scanning hundreds of pages of each proposal, and producing summaries and scores in the procurement process. dubai announced last month that its airports would use ai facial recognition cameras to scan travellers faces while they are on the move, identifying them and officially registering their arrival or departure at the passport control area. this would eliminate the need for them to stop and show their travel documents, gulf news reported. last week, abu dhabis crown prince sheikh khaled bin mohamed bin zayed al nahyan made a two-day official visit to singapore. he met singapore prime minister lawrence wong and both sides signed agreements on ai talent development and other areas. just as southeast asia has had to navigate us-china rivalry in areas like clean technologies and infrastructure development, the uae has needed to do so in ai. uae ai conglomerate g42, which is chaired by emirati national security advisor sheikh tahnoon bin zayed al nahyan, has been at the centre of the us efforts to limit chinas influence in the middle east and ambitions to get ahead in advanced technologies, the new york times reported. g42 announced a partnership with american firm openai in october 2023. the following month, the times reported us agencies were concerned about the extent of g42s work with chinese companies such as huawei that the us considers to be security threats. in april this year, tech giant microsoft announced a us$1.5 billion investment in g42. the deal was sealed after negotiations between the us government and g42, which agreed to divest from china and pivot to american technology, bloomberg reported. the us is applying significant pressure on the uae to abandon its neutrality and choose the us when it comes to tech policy, said researcher sam winter-levy, a technology and international affairs programme fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace, a us think tank. the uae has said it seeks a marriage with the us on ai and appears to have made serious efforts to assuage us concerns about its stewardship of us ai technology, said mr winter-levy. it has pledged that it will lock down its data centres, stripping them of chinese hardware that might have backdoors, screening customers and workers, and monitoring how buyers use their chips, he noted. but mr winter-levy is sceptical any such marriage will be monogamous. the uae has powerful incentives to hedge its bets between china and the us rationally so, given american domestic political instability and the enduring, if eternally frustrated, us desire to pivot to asia, he said. he reckoned the uae will work with the us on ai because it needs american chips and know-how. but it will not cut off its broader relationship with china which is the uaes top non-oil trading partner and will keep trying to hedge its bets between the two states, playing the major powers off against each other to extract concessions, he said. in a visit to washington in september, uae president sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nahyan affirmed his countrys partnership with the us in advanced technologies and the clean energy needed to power ai. in a joint statement, they said their collaboration incorporates safeguards to protect the national security of both countries. asked by foreign journalists last month about the uaes position in the us-china tech rivalry, mr omar sultan al olama, the uaes minister of state for ai, digital economy and remote work applications, said it tries in all domains to maintain a neutral position. however, in technology advancement and development, the uae has been a close partner for the us and has been working with the us and american companies for the last 50 years, since our founding, he said. and were not going to throw that away today. so, we are going to continuously work with the us and if we can work with china, we are going to work with china, he told the foreign media including cna, who were on a press trip organised by the dubai department of economy and tourism. if it upsets the us because of any internal issues, i think we are going to try to work with the us to understand what can be done and what cant be done, and how we can actually proceed on that, but without losing all of the historical advantages that weve had of being a strategic partner us. start-ups say they have not felt any impact of us-china rivalry and are leveraging the ecosystem that the uae and dubai authorities are building. when father-and-son pair avneesh and akshat prakash, both indian citizens, started speech and translation ai company camb.ai about 1.5 years ago, dubais venture capital fund the dubai future district fund put in us$500,000 in pre-seed funding, mr akshat said. the authorities also facilitated camb.ai at every step, helping the co-founders network with customers and investors, said mr avneesh. the dubai ai campus, where camb.ais office is located, is part of the dubai international financial centre (difc), a free zone that allows 100 per cent foreign ownership of companies, has its own financial regulator and is based on english common law instead of the civil and sharia law in the rest of the uae. the ai campus offers resources such as free cloud credit, super computing power and graphics processing units (gpus)-as-a-service. gpus are computing engines integral to ai tasks. although mr akshat had graduated in computer science from carnegie mellon university in the us and worked there for four years, with a stint at apple before launching his own company in san franciscos bay area, dubai was a pretty natural choice for camb.ai. mr avneesh, in his early 50s, had spent his career with tech businesses and had been working and living in dubai for several years. its geographical location literally in the middle of the world makes it possible for camb.ai to attract talent in asia, europe and africa, said mr akshat, 26. dubai is no more than four hours ahead of europe and africa, and no more than four hours behind many parts of asia. i think its impossible to build an international team sitting in the pacific time zone, said mr akshat, referring to san franciscos time zone. even though the bay area might continue to have some of the best talent out of stanford (and other universities), theyre unaffordable for a new company. camb.ais team of close to 50 people are based all over the world. its achievements include partnering mls next pro, a professional men's soccer league in the united states and canada, in april to livestream a match with ai-powered commentary in multiple languages. its ai dubbing platform instantaneously translated the english commentary into french, spanish and portuguese while maintaining the commentators voice and tone. in august, it partnered broadcaster eurovision sport to live-dub 50 hours of commentary from french to portuguese for the 2024 world athletics u20 championships. start-ups are also helping to draw international investments to dubai. the tech platform stake, for instance, allows people from all around the world to invest in dubais booming property market for as little as 500 dirhams (us$137). launched by mr rami tabbara and two co-founders in january 2021, the app has since logged over 800,000 users of over 200 nationalities transacting over half a billion dirhams. users pick which properties on stake that they wish to invest in, and can own a piece of dubai within three minutes, he said. stake is regulated by the dubai financial services authority and follows its know your customer and other rules. about a year ago, it convinced the uae government to let it issue golden visas to users who invest at least 2 million dirhams. over 15 people from singapore have since snagged golden visas through stake, said mr tabbara, 40, a lebanese who has lived in dubai for 20 years. its helped our business massively to be able to issue golden visas, he said, adding that stake worked with the governments dubai future foundation and difc on it. in turn, were able to bring in more investments into dubai through an app, he said. comparing dubai, which has developed rapidly in recent decades, to a start-up, camb.ais mr akshat said one of the companys goals one day is to tell people you can be outside of silicon valley, in new places like dubai, and build incredible things.",1
rules,CNA,Economy,Cybersecurity,11/8/2024 11:55,1.3295034,103.8982716,Ubi,"singaporejakarta after indonesia banned the sale of apples new iphone 16 last month, 34-year-old christine managed to get her hands on the gadget during a trip to singapore. the ban, she says, has only given rise forbidden fruit effect. ive had many people come up to me and ask, where did you buy your phone? and how much did it cost you to bring it here? instead of being able to buy the phone (in indonesia) and benefit indonesian retailers, people are spending their money overseas, said christine, a housewife who declined to provide her full name. i think the ban is misguided, she added. on oct 25, indonesia officially banned the iphone 16s sale in the country because apple had not met the country's rules on use of locally made components. indonesia requires certain smartphones sold domestically to contain at least 40 per cent of parts manufactured locally. a week later on nov 1, the country banned the sale of google pixel phones for the same reason. last year, indonesia blocked the marketplace feature on the popular social media app tiktok, arguing that it was hurting the countrys retail sector with cheap chinese-made goods. the move prompted tiktoks chinese parent company, bytedance, to invest us$1.5 billion in a merger with indonesian e-commerce giant tokopedia this year, gaining re-entry inmarket. on oct 1, indonesia similarly banned chinese e-commerce giant temu, saying the platform could harm the countrys micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes). indonesia is also mulling a tariff of 100 to 200 per cent on imported goods from china, particularly textiles, clothing, footwear and cosmetics. its series of protectionist moves has led observers to caution that while the country could gain investments when companies bend to its rules, its strategy could also backfire. mr bhima yudhistira, director of jakarta-based think-tank centre for economics and law studies, said indonesia is flexing its bargaining power with the ban on the sale of both phones, to get apple and googles alphabet to immediately build factories in the worlds fourth most populous nation. the indonesian governments measure amounts to pseudo protectionism and is its strategy to increase foreign direct investment in the tech industry, he said. unlike its ban on temu and tiktok shop, the phones sale bans are not meant to protect the domestic market, as indonesia still relies on imports for tech products, he told cna. indonesia introduced regulations in 2017 mandating that companies meet certain investment requirements if they want to tap the countrys 270 million-strong market, and its two best-selling phone brands have established manufacturing operations in the country. south korean electronics giant samsung has invested more than us$1.8 billion in indonesia, including building a factory in the outskirts of jakarta to assemble its smartphones in 2015, two years before the regulation was enacted. meanwhile, chinese electronic company oppo invested us$82 million to build a factory west of jakarta in 2022 to build phones for the indonesian market. oppo is the best selling smartphone brand in indonesia with a market share of around 18 per cent, followed by samsung at 17.4 per cent. apples iphone ranked fifth with a market share of 11.5 per cent while the pixel is far behind with less than 1 per cent. in the wake of the ban, apple has proposed an investment of almost us$10 million to make accessories and components for its gadgets in indonesia, business news outlet bloomberg reported on nov 5, quoting an anonymous source. apple has not responded report. mr faisol reza, a deputy industry minister, told cnbc indonesia on wednesday (nov 6) that it is in talks with apple, but did not elaborate. apples investment pledge could be seen as a win for indonesia. the creation of jobs is important to indonesias economic and political stability, noted maybank analyst etta rusdiana putra. the (indonesian) government also wants to reduce imports to improve its trade balance, help its currency, and maintain indonesian purchasing power. but heavy-handed moves could backfire and deter other companies from entering or scaling up their presence in the country, undermining newly-minted president prabowo subiantos efforts to attract foreign investment, analysts say. on the potential tariff on chinese goods, dr siwage dharma negara, a senior fellow at singapores iseas-yusof ishak institute, said china is indonesias most important trading partner... the country is also dependent on chinas investment in the downstream industry. so, (indonesia) will be careful in implementing unilateral trade restrictions that can potentially worsen the economic relations or trigger retaliations. mr prabowo is seen as following the playbook of his predecessor joko jokowi widodo, who is considered instrumental in the formers ascent to presidency. mr prabowo, who has promised to continue many of jokowis programmes and policies, has reappointed several members of jokowis cabinet. they include mr agus gumiwang kartasasmita, who reprised his role as industry minister, and mr zulkifli hasan, a former trade minister who is now the coordinating minister for food affairs. mr gumiwang is behind the iphone 16 and google pixel sale bans, while it was mr zulkifli who first stated indonesia is mulling tariffs on chinese-made goods. given many of the economic team members in (prabowos) cabinet are old faces, i don't think there are any substantial differences in (prabowos and jokowis) approaches, said dr muhammad faisal, director of jakarta-based think-tank centre of reform on economics (core). but jokowis protectionism approach has seen pushback from other countries. in 2022, the world trade organization ruled in favour of the european union in a dispute over indonesias ban on nickel ore exports, which jokowi introduced as indonesia sought to become a major player in the production of batteries for electric vehicles. the eu argued the ban was hurting europes stainless steel industry. indonesia is appealing the decision and has not lifted its export ban. in 2017, the wto also ruled in favour of the united states and new zealand over indonesia's restrictions on imports of food and animal products between 2013 and 2014, which aimed to deal with temporary surpluses in the domestic market. mr bhima said indonesia could face a similar case if it continues to go down the current protectionist path. in recent years, indonesia has seen a sharp decline in its middle-class population from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, which left many businesses and factories shuttered. mr prabowo has promised to create 19 million jobs and the best way to do that, analysts say, is to attract more foreign investments to revive its languishing manufacturing sector. but forcing companies to invest through the threat of tariffs and import bans is not the way to go, experts say. after combining its tiktok shop with tokopedia, bytedance reportedly began slashing about 450 jobs at its indonesian e-commerce arm from june. the reduction makes up about 9 per cent of the arms employees, bloomberg reported. to attract investment, policy consistency is crucial. discriminatory treatment should also not be applied between foreign and domestic investors for whatever policy the government wants to impose, said mr faisal of core. indonesia needs to upskill its workforce, remove red tape and reduce the cost of shipping goods across the vast archipelago by building infrastructure like ports and roads, he added. it needs to address the underlying problems that prevent local products from competing with cheap imported goods and protect indonesias msmes, which account for 61 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product and employ 97 per cent of the workforce. the problems (faced by) sme business actors in indonesia is not only competition with imported goods but also high lending rates, a fairly high skills gap for sme employees, low quality control and uncompetitive logistics costs, mr bhima of celios said. rather than carrying out baseless protectionism, the government should solve (these) fundamental problems. according asian development bank, high technology costs and limited financial support have posed a problem for indonesias small business operators. in adapting realities of a global online marketplace where consumers can buy competitively-priced goods from abroad, dr siwage from iseas-yusof ishak institute said there are opportunities for indonesia. citing the success of local e-commerce platforms tokopedia and bukalapak that are now considered unicorns start-ups valued at over us$1 billion dr siwage said the country could create a better environment for more local start-ups to flourish. (indonesia) should design policies and incentives for foreign investors to collaborate with local investors, he said, noting that tokopedias merger with tiktok shop could be a business model for other companies. the ban on iphone 16 and google pixel phones have so far spurred many to seek the products in the black market or overseas, potentially costing indonesia millions of dollars in sales tax. indonesian industry ministry spokesman febri hendri said that as of last month, 9,000 iphone 16 units have entered indonesia. the units were bought overseas and are now being privately used. mr febri said his office will make sure that the phones will not be resold and enter the indonesian market. the cheapest iphone 16 is priced at about s$1,299 (us$994) in singapore, according to apple. buyers from indonesia will have to pay an additional us$155 in import duties if they want to bring the iphone into their country. shortly after the ban on oct 25, indonesian e-commerce websites were flooded with people claiming to be selling the new phone. mr febri said the ministry has asked these marketplaces to take down these offers, and many have complied. we ask people not to be tempted to buy iphone 16 from marketplaces and unofficial offline stores. we will take action on any information regarding the selling and buying of iphone 16, mr febri said in a statement on nov 1. some consumers have nonetheless fallen prey to dishonest sellers. university student oriza placed her iphone 16 order with a seller who claimed that the phone was bought overseas and had been modified in such a way it can circumvent indonesias ban on the product. full of anticipation when a delivery man came knocking on her door late last month, the 21-year-old jakarta resident was soon let down. when i opened the box, it was actually an iphone 13, said ms oriza, who declined to provide her full name. she has since tried to contact the seller for a refund and has also contacted the online marketplace for the seller to be blacklisted, but her attempts have yet to bear fruit.",1

investments when companies bend to its rules, its strategy could also backfire. mr bhima yudhistira, director of jakarta-based think-tank centre for economics and law studies, said indonesia is flexing its bargaining power with the ban on the sale of both phones, to get apple and googles alphabet to immediately build factories in the worlds fourth most populous nation. the indonesian governments measure amounts to pseudo protectionism and is its strategy to increase foreign direct investment in the tech industry, he said. unlike its ban on temu and tiktok shop, the phones sale bans are not meant to protect the domestic market, as indonesia still relies on imports for tech products, he told cna. indonesia introduced regulations in 2017 mandating that companies meet certain investment requirements if they want to tap the countrys 270 million-strong market, and its two best-selling phone brands have established manufacturing operations in the country. south korean electronics giant samsung has invested more than us$1.8 billion in indonesia, including building a factory in the outskirts of jakarta to assemble its smartphones in 2015, two years before the regulation was enacted. meanwhile, chinese electronic company oppo invested us$82 million to build a factory west of jakarta in 2022 to build phones for the indonesian market. oppo is the best selling smartphone brand in indonesia with a market share of around 18 per cent, followed by samsung at 17.4 per cent. apples iphone ranked fifth with a market share of 11.5 per cent while the pixel is far behind with less than 1 per cent. in the wake of the ban, apple has proposed an investment of almost us$10 million to make accessories and components for its gadgets in indonesia, business news outlet bloomberg reported on nov 5, quoting an anonymous source. apple has not responded report. mr faisol reza, a deputy industry minister, told cnbc indonesia on wednesday (nov 6) that it is in talks with apple, but did not elaborate. apples investment pledge could be seen as a win for indonesia. the creation of jobs is important to indonesias economic and political stability, noted maybank analyst etta rusdiana putra. the (indonesian) government also wants to reduce imports to improve its trade balance, help its currency, and maintain indonesian purchasing power. but heavy-handed moves could backfire and deter other companies from entering or scaling up their presence in the country, undermining newly-minted president prabowo subiantos efforts to attract foreign investment, analysts say. on the potential tariff on chinese goods, dr siwage dharma negara, a senior fellow at singapores iseas-yusof ishak institute, said china is indonesias most important trading partner... the country is also dependent on chinas investment in the downstream industry. so, (indonesia) will be careful in implementing unilateral trade restrictions that can potentially worsen the economic relations or trigger retaliations. mr prabowo is seen as following the playbook of his predecessor joko jokowi widodo, who is considered instrumental in the formers ascent to presidency. mr prabowo, who has promised to continue many of jokowis programmes and policies, has reappointed several members of jokowis cabinet. they include mr agus gumiwang kartasasmita, who reprised his role as industry minister, and mr zulkifli hasan, a former trade minister who is now the coordinating minister for food affairs. mr gumiwang is behind the iphone 16 and google pixel sale bans, while it was mr zulkifli who first stated indonesia is mulling tariffs on chinese-made goods. given many of the economic team members in (prabowos) cabinet are old faces, i don't think there are any substantial differences in (prabowos and jokowis) approaches, said dr muhammad faisal, director of jakarta-based think-tank centre of reform on economics (core). but jokowis protectionism approach has seen pushback from other countries. in 2022, the world trade organization ruled in favour of the european union in a dispute over indonesias ban on nickel ore exports, which jokowi introduced as indonesia sought to become a major player in the production of batteries for electric vehicles. the eu argued the ban was hurting europes stainless steel industry. indonesia is appealing the decision and has not lifted its export ban. in 2017, the wto also ruled in favour of the united states and new zealand over indonesia's restrictions on imports of food and animal products between 2013 and 2014, which aimed to deal with temporary surpluses in the domestic market. mr bhima said indonesia could face a similar case if it continues to go down the current protectionist path. in recent years, indonesia has seen a sharp decline in its middle-class population from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, which left many businesses and factories shuttered. mr prabowo has promised to create 19 million jobs and the best way to do that, analysts say, is to attract more foreign investments to revive its languishing manufacturing sector. but forcing companies to invest through the threat of tariffs and import bans is not the way to go, experts say. after combining its tiktok shop with tokopedia, bytedance reportedly began slashing about 450 jobs at its indonesian e-commerce arm from june. the reduction makes up about 9 per cent of the arms employees, bloomberg reported. to attract investment, policy consistency is crucial. discriminatory treatment should also not be applied between foreign and domestic investors for whatever policy the government wants to impose, said mr faisal of core. indonesia needs to upskill its workforce, remove red tape and reduce the cost of shipping goods across the vast archipelago by building infrastructure like ports and roads, he added. it needs to address the underlying problems that prevent local products from competing with cheap imported goods and protect indonesias msmes, which account for 61 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product and employ 97 per cent of the workforce. the problems (faced by) sme business actors in indonesia is not only competition with imported goods but also high lending rates, a fairly high skills gap for sme employees, low quality control and uncompetitive logistics costs, mr bhima of celios said. rather than carrying out baseless protectionism, the government should solve (these) fundamental problems. according asian development bank, high technology costs and limited financial support have posed a problem for indonesias small business operators. in adapting realities of a global online marketplace where consumers can buy competitively-priced goods from abroad, dr siwage from iseas-yusof ishak institute said there are opportunities for indonesia. citing the success of local e-commerce platforms tokopedia and bukalapak that are now considered unicorns start-ups valued at over us$1 billion dr siwage said the country could create a better environment for more local start-ups to flourish. (indonesia) should design policies and incentives for foreign investors to collaborate with local investors, he said, noting that tokopedias merger with tiktok shop could be a business model for other companies. the ban on iphone 16 and google pixel phones have so far spurred many to seek the products in the black market or overseas, potentially costing indonesia millions of dollars in sales tax. indonesian industry ministry spokesman febri hendri said that as of last month, 9,000 iphone 16 units have entered indonesia. the units were bought overseas and are now being privately used. mr febri said his office will make sure that the phones will not be resold and enter the indonesian market. the cheapest iphone 16 is priced at about s$1,299 (us$994) in singapore, according to apple. buyers from indonesia will have to pay an additional us$155 in import duties if they want to bring the iphone into their country. shortly after the ban on oct 25, indonesian e-commerce websites were flooded with people claiming to be selling the new phone. mr febri said the ministry has asked these marketplaces to take down these offers, and many have complied. we ask people not to be tempted to buy iphone 16 from marketplaces and unofficial offline stores. we will take action on any information regarding the selling and buying of iphone 16, mr febri said in a statement on nov 1. some consumers have nonetheless fallen prey to dishonest sellers. university student oriza placed her iphone 16 order with a seller who claimed that the phone was bought overseas and had been modified in such a way it can circumvent indonesias ban on the product. full of anticipation when a delivery man came knocking on her door late last month, the 21-year-old jakarta resident was soon let down. when i opened the box, it was actually an iphone 13, said ms oriza, who declined to provide her full name. she has since tried to contact the seller for a refund and has also contacted the online marketplace for the seller to be blacklisted, but her attempts have yet to bear fruit.",1

major player in the production of batteries for electric vehicles. the eu argued the ban was hurting europes stainless steel industry. indonesia is appealing the decision and has not lifted its export ban. in 2017, the wto also ruled in favour of the united states and new zealand over indonesia's restrictions on imports of food and animal products between 2013 and 2014, which aimed to deal with temporary surpluses in the domestic market. mr bhima said indonesia could face a similar case if it continues to go down the current protectionist path. in recent years, indonesia has seen a sharp decline in its middle-class population from the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, which left many businesses and factories shuttered. mr prabowo has promised to create 19 million jobs and the best way to do that, analysts say, is to attract more foreign investments to revive its languishing manufacturing sector. but forcing companies to invest through the threat of tariffs and import bans is not the way to go, experts say. after combining its tiktok shop with tokopedia, bytedance reportedly began slashing about 450 jobs at its indonesian e-commerce arm from june. the reduction makes up about 9 per cent of the arms employees, bloomberg reported. to attract investment, policy consistency is crucial. discriminatory treatment should also not be applied between foreign and domestic investors for whatever policy the government wants to impose, said mr faisal of core. indonesia needs to upskill its workforce, remove red tape and reduce the cost of shipping goods across the vast archipelago by building infrastructure like ports and roads, he added. it needs to address the underlying problems that prevent local products from competing with cheap imported goods and protect indonesias msmes, which account for 61 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product and employ 97 per cent of the workforce. the problems (faced by) sme business actors in indonesia is not only competition with imported goods but also high lending rates, a fairly high skills gap for sme employees, low quality control and uncompetitive logistics costs, mr bhima of celios said. rather than carrying out baseless protectionism, the government should solve (these) fundamental problems. according asian development bank, high technology costs and limited financial support have posed a problem for indonesias small business operators. in adapting realities of a global online marketplace where consumers can buy competitively-priced goods from abroad, dr siwage from iseas-yusof ishak institute said there are opportunities for indonesia. citing the success of local e-commerce platforms tokopedia and bukalapak that are now considered unicorns start-ups valued at over us$1 billion dr siwage said the country could create a better environment for more local start-ups to flourish. (indonesia) should design policies and incentives for foreign investors to collaborate with local investors, he said, noting that tokopedias merger with tiktok shop could be a business model for other companies. the ban on iphone 16 and google pixel phones have so far spurred many to seek the products in the black market or overseas, potentially costing indonesia millions of dollars in sales tax. indonesian industry ministry spokesman febri hendri said that as of last month, 9,000 iphone 16 units have entered indonesia. the units were bought overseas and are now being privately used. mr febri said his office will make sure that the phones will not be resold and enter the indonesian market. the cheapest iphone 16 is priced at about s$1,299 (us$994) in singapore, according to apple. buyers from indonesia will have to pay an additional us$155 in import duties if they want to bring the iphone into their country. shortly after the ban on oct 25, indonesian e-commerce websites were flooded with people claiming to be selling the new phone. mr febri said the ministry has asked these marketplaces to take down these offers, and many have complied. we ask people not to be tempted to buy iphone 16 from marketplaces and unofficial offline stores. we will take action on any information regarding the selling and buying of iphone 16, mr febri said in a statement on nov 1. some consumers have nonetheless fallen prey to dishonest sellers. university student oriza placed her iphone 16 order with a seller who claimed that the phone was bought overseas and had been modified in such a way it can circumvent indonesias ban on the product. full of anticipation when a delivery man came knocking on her door late last month, the 21-year-old jakarta resident was soon let down. when i opened the box, it was actually an iphone 13, said ms oriza, who declined to provide her full name. she has since tried to contact the seller for a refund and has also contacted the online marketplace for the seller to be blacklisted, but her attempts have yet to bear fruit.",1
regulations,CNA,Economy,Cybersecurity,11/8/2024 11:55,1.3335251,103.959537,Expo,"singaporejakarta after indonesia banned the sale of apples new iphone 16 last month, 34-year-old christine managed to get her hands on the gadget during a trip to singapore. the ban, she says, has only given rise forbidden fruit effect. ive had many people come up to me and ask, where did you buy your phone? and how much did it cost you to bring it here? instead of being able to buy the phone (in indonesia) and benefit indonesian retailers, people are spending their money overseas, said christine, a housewife who declined to provide her full name. i think the ban is misguided, she added. on oct 25, indonesia officially banned the iphone 16s sale in the country because apple had not met the country's rules on use of locally made components. indonesia requires certain smartphones sold domestically to contain at least 40 per cent of parts manufactured locally. a week later on nov 1, the country banned the sale of google pixel phones for the same reason. last year, indonesia blocked the marketplace feature on the popular social media app tiktok, arguing that it was hurting the countrys retail sector with cheap chinese-made goods. the move prompted tiktoks chinese parent company, bytedance, to invest us$1.5 billion in a merger with indonesian e-commerce giant tokopedia this year, gaining re-entry inmarket. on oct 1, indonesia similarly banned chinese e-commerce giant temu, saying the platform could harm the countrys micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes). indonesia is also mulling a tariff of 100 to 200 per cent on imported goods from china, particularly textiles, clothing, footwear and cosmetics. its series of protectionist moves has led observers to caution that while the country could gain investments when companies bend to its rules, its strategy could also backfire. mr bhima yudhistira, director of jakarta-based think-tank centre for economics and law studies, said indonesia is flexing its bargaining power with the ban on the sale of both phones, to get apple and googles alphabet to immediately build factories in the worlds fourth most populous nation. the indonesian governments measure amounts to pseudo protectionism and is its strategy to increase foreign direct investment in the tech industry, he said. unlike its ban on temu and tiktok shop, the phones sale bans are not meant to protect the domestic market, as indonesia still relies on imports for tech products, he told cna. indonesia introduced regulations in 2017 mandating that companies meet certain investment requirements if they want to tap the countrys 270 million-strong market, and its two best-selling phone brands have established manufacturing operations in the country. south korean electronics giant samsung has invested more than us$1.8 billion in indonesia, including building a factory in the outskirts of jakarta to assemble its smartphones in 2015, two years before the regulation was enacted. meanwhile, chinese electronic company oppo invested us$82 million to build a factory west of jakarta in 2022 to build phones for the indonesian market. oppo is the best selling smartphone brand in indonesia with a market share of around 18 per cent, followed by samsung at 17.4 per cent. apples iphone ranked fifth with a market share of 11.5 per cent while the pixel is far behind with less than 1 per cent. in the wake of the ban, apple has proposed an investment of almost us$10 million to make accessories and components for its gadgets in indonesia, business news outlet bloomberg reported on nov 5, quoting an anonymous source. apple has not responded report. mr faisol reza, a deputy industry minister, told cnbc indonesia on wednesday (nov 6) that it is in talks with apple, but did not elaborate. apples investment pledge could be seen as a win for indonesia. the creation of jobs is important to indonesias economic and political stability, noted maybank analyst etta rusdiana putra. the (indonesian) government also wants to reduce imports to improve its trade balance, help its currency, and maintain indonesian purchasing power. but heavy-handed moves could backfire and deter other companies from entering or scaling up their presence in the country, undermining newly-minted president prabowo subiantos efforts to attract foreign investment, analysts say. on the potential tariff on chinese goods, dr siwage dharma negara, a senior fellow at singapores iseas-yusof ishak institute, said china is indonesias most important trading partner... the country is also dependent on chinas investment in the downstream industry. so, (indonesia) will be careful in implementing unilateral trade restrictions that can potentially worsen the economic relations or trigger retaliations. mr prabowo is seen as following the playbook of his predecessor joko jokowi widodo, who is considered instrumental in the formers ascent to presidency. mr prabowo, who has promised to continue many of jokowis programmes and policies, has reappointed several members of jokowis cabinet. they include mr agus gumiwang kartasasmita, who reprised his role as industry minister, and mr zulkifli hasan, a former trade minister who is now the coordinating minister for food affairs. mr gumiwang is behind the iphone 16 and google pixel sale bans, while it was mr zulkifli who first stated indonesia is mulling tariffs on chinese-made goods. given many of the economic team members in (prabowos) cabinet are old faces, i don't think there are any substantial differences in (prabowos and jokowis) approaches, said dr muhammad faisal, director of jakarta-based think-tank centre of reform on economics (core). but jokowis protectionism approach has seen pushback from other countries. in 2022, the world trade organization ruled in favour of the european union in a dispute over indonesias ban on nickel ore exports, which jokowi introduced as indonesia sought to become a

rules,CNA,Community Behavior,Social Interactions,11/6/2024 7:52,,,,"singapore as a child, games always piqued thomas luthers interest. but for somebody with dysmelia - a genetic condition that affects his hands - there were certain activities that mr luther could not safely participate in. while he was still socially connected to most of his peers, mr luther was left feeling like an outsider when he wasnt picked for sports such as football. it sometimes made me very sad, because i wanted (to join in) but obviously i couldnt, he told cna. what was the big equaliser was the game of chess. chess was compensating for that. i enjoyed chess where it offered equal opportunities compared to other sports, said mr luther, who is singapore chess federation's (scf) training director. i was always enjoying the community. for me, chess was always a social thing. i had friends in the chess family but also outside (but) outside of chess, i always felt a bit more lonely than inside of chess. today, mr luther is a grandmaster - the highest title a chess player can achieve. chess has seen a resurgence in singapore, at both the elite level for players such as mr luther and at the recreational level, where the communal aspect of the game is the main draw. on the surface, chess is an individual game, a battle of wits between two people. but it also draws in spectators who are invested in every match whether amateur or elite. in parts of singapore, you can spot people huddled around two players on stone tables, silently watching but for collective gasps or smiles as a checkmate draws closer. this type of bond is at the heart of chess, and building a community was one of the reasons hirfan romzi decided to start aliwal chess club (acc) in late 2021. what started as an open invitation to mr hirfans friends and acquaintances to hang out, drink tea and play chess has now produced a thriving group that meets at least twice a month. today, acc has become so popular that some leave comments on the group's instagram account to ask when the next event will be held. there are even tourists who want to know when the next meeting will be. back in 2021, only a handful of his friends and acquaintances showed up, but mr hirfan noticed that there were passers-by who joined the gatherings. a few weeks later, he decided to start the club. in the early days of acc, actually most people came not for chess but just to hang out, mr hirfan told cna. about three years since its inception, acc has brought chess to places such as cafes, museums and music festivals. it organises various events such as street chess meets, which typically see about 40 players, and its annual world chess day festivals, which draw crowds of hundreds. the club has a diverse range of participants, from new players to those who play chess competitively, added mr hirfan. on a personal level, i just love bringing people together, gathering people, just talking to them, making new friends and gaining more connections, he said. over the years ... there are people coming up to me or texting to acc (how) its nice for them to have found a place, a sense of belonging, (to) really just chill with us and make new friends. the club is about more than just chess, said mr hifan. in acc itself, chess is actually just 20 per cent of the whole thing. the other 80 per cent is what surrounds it its really the creative community that surrounds it that makes us who we are, always providing platforms for creatives, for musicians, for stuff like that, he explained. acc also provides networking opportunities and in the case of mr hirfan, a graphic designer, it has even opened the door to a role in a lifestyle events company. singapore chess federation ceo kevin goh told cna that the vast majority of chess players in singapore play recreationally and simply want to learn the game and make new friends. without such events, chess players are only able to play online, which deprives them (of) the communal side of things, he added. eventually the interest will also die down because not all chess players are super interested in improving their game significantly. the federation is the principal authority over all chess events in the country, and a member of the singapore national olympic council and singapore sports council. in addition community-building aspects of chess, there are other clear benefits. dr ong mian li, founder and principal clinical psychologist at lightfull psychology, said chess can be likened to a gym for the mind. the nature of chess involves predicting and strategising against what your opponent might do, he explained. with chess, you have to predict, memorise a lot of moves it builds memory, focus and decision-making. its just like when you lift weights you build muscle, when you play chess it strengthens the mind. although chess does not directly increase ones iq, dr ong stressed that it builds other important skills, such as focus and resilience. it encourages you to embrace failure, find a lesson, even though its really painful and annoying, he explained. with kids, their brains are still developing and so when they lose' in life - be it at the playground or in chess, it can feel really huge. the game itself really gives parents a great tool to invite kids to learn and grow, to embrace the idea of failure. given that chess is about making decisions based on objective facts, the same decision-making process can be applied to life choices as well, said mr goh. the scf chief left his job as a former chief financial officer in a biotech start-up at the end of 2022 to concentrate on the federation full-time. for some parents, such as eight-year-old ashwath kaushiks mother rohini ramachandran, it is about supporting their childrens interests. we started it because he was a bit bored and we wanted something to keep him engaged, she recalled. we didnt expect at that time he would take to it so much but when he started it, he really liked it. a few months after picking up chess at the age of four, ashwath was able to beat family members, she recalled. at that point, we said maybe we should get a coach to teach him because clearly hes already learnt whatever he can from us, said mdm rohini. earlier this year, he became the youngest player ever to defeat a grandmaster in classical chess after he beat polish grandmaster jacek stopa at the burgdorfer stadthaus open in switzerland. its strategic you need a lot of thinking and its very difficult and complex. its like a brain teaser, said ashwath, when asked whats the best part about chess. ashwath plays about two to three hours of chess during school days and from six to seven hours on the weekends a mix of playing online and in person at the scf. his goal is to become a grandmaster by age 12, which would make him one of the youngest in the world to achieve the feat. at the youth level, 1,606 players competed in the 75th national schools individual chess championship earlier this year. this was close to a 20 per cent increase from the number in 2022, which had already been a record. given the numbers, an additional venue had to be booked for the competition, said mr goh. the federation has also expanded its national training programme (ntp) to include more age groups. launched in april last year, the programme aims to nurture the countrys next generation of chess talent. where it used to comprise under-10 and under-14 squads, there are now under-8, under-12, under-16 and under-20 squads. the potential and the interest has always been there, said mr goh, who said he was not at all surprised by the growth of the sport locally. ironically, the pandemic benefited chess, said mr luther. with covid-19 restrictions limiting various activities, many turned game. many kids during that time started to play chess. we see that kids in the age group of six to 10 learnt the rules of chess, and now they come ... scf for regular training and playing tournaments. this made a huge impact on the numbers of kids, he explained. added to this is the proliferation of chess content online, with chess youtubers and live streamers, pointed out mr hirfan. and it is this side to chess that appeals to children, said mdm rohini. theres a lot of online aspects to chess which have developed and i think that has helped increase the interest, because its not just about sitting in the classes and learning, she explained. theres (also) a little bit of gamification around some of these aspects of solving chess puzzles which would make it a bit more interesting and fun for kids as well. all of that has kind of helped to ... reignite that interest in chess. in ashwath's case, being able to play online also helped speed up his chess development, said his mother. he wouldnt have been able to do very much until all the restrictions eased, until it was safe to go out and meet in person and play, she recalled. he has that option of playing with people around the world, it gives him a lot more practice that he can do at home as well it played a big role and that has also played a big role in why you see so many strong, younger chess players coming up around the world as well. chess reach also expanded with the hit netflix series the queens gambit, which inspired a surge of interest when it was released in late 2020. we have to thank the queens gambit, said mr hirfan. that definitely changed the narrative of chess on a mainstream level. it is not just children who are discovering a new love for chess - adults are getting in on the act. there are a lot of closet chess fans that i only got to know of in the last two years, said mr goh. we also try to have more events that are more targeted towards adults. the federation restarted a chess league for those 20 years old and above, and brought back the national seniors championship. a lot of working adults enjoy the adult chess league. because there is no stress and the communal side of things is important, said mr goh. mr hirfan has noticed this at acc as well, where adult players are rediscovering their love for the game. a lot of our players (say they) used to play in primary school and back then, he said. acc becomes that bridge to help people to reconnect (with the sport). while chess has not entirely shed the stereotype that it is nerdy, the demographic of those playing chess at a high level has changed, mr goh added. more young people are playing chess. we have people like magnus (carlsen), undeniably a very cool person, and generally the profile of the best chess players in the world are younger, he said. people feel that if chess players are cool, chess is cool. mr goh said that he has never seen chess as popular as it is now and he has played it for 30 years. it is not just singapore that is seeing a spike in interest in chess. the sport has also grown particularly in india and other parts of southeast asia, international chess federation (fide) ceo emil sutovsky told cna. in southeast asia, we see the interest going up (it is) mostly people are just having fun and playing online and that is normal. but we also see growing interest in following competitions, following players, in particular when the representative of the country is fighting for an important championship, he said. what has been important is the constant availability of events for chess enthusiasts to participate in, said mr goh. recognising the importance of events when it comes to building interest, the federation allows independent entities to hold fide-rated tournaments locally. there are at least five other organisers of these events in singapore, he said. the idea is to be as inclusive as possible, provide more access masses and give players a chance to improve their fide ranking, said mr goh. we recognise that its important to have more (events), and overall it's beneficial for us. we dont see organisers as competition. chess needs all the help we can get, so we have to work with each other, he added. earlier this year, it was announced that singapore beat india's new delhi and chennai to win the rights to host the world chess championship for the first time. the tournament will take place between nov 20 and dec 15, pitting world champion, chinas 31-year-old grandmaster ding liren, against india's 18-year-old grandmaster dommaraju gukesh. everyone is super excited, said mr goh. there are people who come to me who i havent spoken with in 10 years (after) they quit chess, and they all say this is a very exciting event and well definitely turn up. the fide world championship match is held every two years. it features the defending world champion and a challenger, chosen through a qualification process culminating in the candidates tournament, which includes eight of the world's top players. ding and gukesh, the youngest challenger in championship history, will vie for the crown over a best-of-14 format. singapore was a very natural choice, mr sutovsky. not only is it a neutral venue for the match between ding and gukesh, but it has a strong standing reputation in hosting important events, he pointed out. another event held in conjunction with the world chess championship will be the singapore international open, where players such as ashwath will be competing. he definitely wants to be there and weve already got tickets for some of the matches and hes really looking forward to it, said mdm rohini. also competing at the open will be siddharth jagadeesh, who became singapores youngest local grandmaster earlier this year at 17. having competed against gukesh twice, he is looking forward to watching him compete at the world championship. the hope is that the world chess championship will strengthen the chess community in singapore, he added. its our job to make sure we can continue this momentum, said mr goh. we have to keep on doing more and more things, but in order to do that, we need support. as more people pick up chess recreationally, it has created a positive effect at the elite level. mr goh became a grandmaster in 2020. at the time, he was only the third singaporean to reach that title, which is awarded by fide and held for life. fast forward four years, singapore now has five grandmasters and a woman grandmaster. grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain and can be held by anyone. the woman grandmaster is a separate title that can only be held by a woman. two grandmasters mr siddharth and 24-year-old tin jingyao are under 30. we know that singapore in recent years has experienced a sort of a chess boom, for many years they have had young players among the top of the world in their age group. now we see players emerge and they are competing internationally, said fides mr sutovsky. this was a considerable success for a country like singapore which is much much smaller than india, china and so on it still manages to produce several players that are of a world calibre. the ingredients for success are there, said mr goh. for one, parents in singapore are willing to invest in their childrens chess dreams, he pointed out. in other countries, one trainer may instruct about 20 students, but the ratio is often one-to-one in singapore, he added. it is clear that supportive parents play a key role. today, ashwath competes in about 15 tournaments in a year, said his mother, who left her job and now regularly accompanies him to various international meets. both of us were fairly clear that once he started showing interest and also some potential, we wanted to support him any way we could, she explained. having picked up chess from his father at the age of six, siddharth has also benefited from the support of his parents, both of whom are still working. they were not so strict with school, they allowed me to spend a lot more time on chess than was normal in singapore. they helped send me to tournaments, travel with me and take a lot of leave, he added. mdm rohini added that the federation has done a lot in having coaching classes and these have helped spur interest in younger children. now they have a lot of avenues to learn it in group settings, apart from having to look for individual coaches which you may or may not find, or may or may not want to do until you see how much interest the kids have, she said. all of them have contributed a lot to increasing the general interest in chess among kids. siddharth attributes some of his success help of coaches from the federation such as uzbek grandmaster andrey kvon, having worked more closely with them since 2022. mr kvon is also scf's assistant training director. i was having a lot of psychological problems. coach andrey (in particular) had many conversations with me to try to get me to be more ambitious, he recalled. but there remains much room for improvement when it comes to cultivating talent, said mr goh. jingyao and siddharth were already talented and dedicated even before we came on board, he explained. now the question is how do we identify these talents, these kids who are passionate so that we can bring them on a five- to 10-year plan, so they can eventually be the next jingyao or siddharth. and this is where mr goh hopes the national training programme will come in. its going to be a long-term thing, theres no sugarcoating this, he explained. i hope that the ntp can eventually produce talent like that on a recurring basis. from our under-8 and under-10 teams, there are some super promising kids (that are) world-level, added mr luther. these are our hopes. (when it comes to) results, the earliest we can see it will be maybe two years, three years, maybe even later. but the hope is there. fide's mr sutovsky is optimistic about what the future will hold for singapore. i believe singapore will very soon be competing (to be one of the) top 10 asian teams ... very soon it can be there, he said.",1

the summit starts on nov 11 and is meant to close on nov 22 - while in the background, scientists continue to warn that the planets vital signs are in bad shape and time for marked progress is imperative. while attendance at cop29 is not expected to reach the 100,000 over delegates that were seen at cop28 in dubai last year, this edition still looms as an important moment in climate talks. here are five key issues to pay attention to when cop29 commences. azerbaijans cop leadership is unabashed in its desire to make finance the central pillar of the talks. its summit agenda is centred around money. whether we like it or not, finance will be at the core of this year's climate negotiations, cop29 ceo elnur soltanov told cna. finance cannot be understood in abstract terms. finance is there to enable action. perhaps of most importance will be the negotiations around the new collective quantified goal (ncqg). this financial framework is designed to replace the us$100 billion in climate finance that developed economies had pledged in 2009 to provide to poorer nations every year by 2020. by and large, those funds have not been delivered, prompting an attempt to overhaul an import pathway for finances to reach the countries that need climate support most. that original pledged amount was arbitrary and not connected to actual needs of other countries but it had become a benchmark collective commitment. its effectiveness was widely questioned - especially by developing nations - whose needs have increased year on year, highlighting the need for a more robust and effective financial mechanism, according world economic forum. lead negotiators on the ncqg have said that the funding needs are in the trillions of dollars every year. we need enablers, we need means of implementation. we have finance, technology and capacity-building, and finance definitely is the most important thing out there, mr soltanov said. who will give money, in what form and how much - in transparent and accessible ways - will all be negotiated further in baku, amid calls for an escalation in urgency from the un. growing the loss and damage fun which was operationalised in dubai for countries bearing the worst of climate impacts, will also be a key focus. us$700 million was pledged fund last year but various research estimates that developing countries actually need hundreds of billions of dollars annually to properly address the loss and damage issue. there are still issues surrounding how the world bank hosts the fund, the integrity of the board and arrangements to ensure money is easily accessible. additionally, there will be a push to close the wide gap on funding for adaptation, the ability for countries to handle and live with climate impacts. it is an area long overlooked compared with funding for climate mitigation efforts and the world bank is aiming to equalise the money going into both areas in 2024. a 2021 report by climate policy initiative found that only 10 per cent of climate financing was directed to adaptation. international climate finance must grow up, step up, and scale up, to meet this moment, said mr simon stiell, the executive secretary of un climate change in a speech at an event hosted by the brookings institute, a washington dc-based non-profit organisation, last month. in times like these, there is a temptation to turn inward. so let's instead choose the game-changer path ahead the one that recognises that bigger and better climate finance is entirely in every nation's interests, and can deliver results everywhere, he said. the planet is in worse shape than 12 months ago, scientists say. global temperatures have continued to increase, with surface and ocean temperatures both hitting record highs. average temperatures made the 12 months between september 2023 and august 2024 the hottest year-long period ever, 1.64 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. the paris agreement is aimed to keep temperatures within 1.5 degrees celsius above these levels. heat records were broken in 19 countries, including laos and cambodia. concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane - a much more powerful pollutant in terms of heat contribution - are at all-time high levels in the atmosphere as fossil fuel production has continued to rise. climate change has also been strongly linked to intensified droughts, hurricanes and flood events across the world in 2024. in the six months following cop28 last year, the damage estimates from extreme weather cost us$41 billion globally, highlighting the need for collective action on solutions, adaptation funding and improved mitigation efforts at cop29. central to azerbaijans presidency of cop29 will be to lead the worlds shift away from a fossil-fuel powered future. but oil and gas are the very resources that have driven the countrys prosperity for generations. and the modern-day reliance on them continues those sectors account for an estimated 90 per cent of its exports and half of total gross domestic product. just this year, azerbaijan president ilham aliyev said that oil was a gift from god. for three consecutive years, an oil-producing nation has led the summit, following the united arab emirates last year and egypt in 2022. last year, for the first time, the final cop agreement included wording about fossil fuels, calling for transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner. 30 years to get beginning of the end for fossil fuels, the european union noted at the time, referring three decades of cop summits, started in 1995. the statement was a reflection of the steep opposition and lobbying that had derailed efforts to wean off the polluting fuels at previous meetings. but there was no declared phase out or phase down of fossil fuels decided in dubai, leaving the worlds polluters carte blanche to continue their operations. the same arguments over phrasing can be expected to dominate discussions and could once again stymie the final agreement between nations in baku. in the year since the dubai summit, war has intensified and spread in the middle east. conflicts are ongoing in ukraine, sudan and myanmar. given the cop process is reliant on cooperation between countries and requires consensus to make a formal declaration, the breakdown in trust is seen as a strong impediment to planet-saving action. usually, climate negotiations have been insulated. but, this level of tension is unprecedented in modern times, said dr jennifer allan, a senior lecturer in international relations at cardiff university. resources are going to defence budgets and attention is anywhere but climate. these clashes have other impacts, beyond government-to-government relations. they are significant contributors to emissions - military operations in gaza are estimated to have contributed substantial greenhouse gas emissions. including future rebuilding efforts, the conflict could end up causing the equivalent of 61 million tonnes of co2 - more than the annual emissions of 135 individual nations, according to researchers from the united kingdom and united states. conflict and climate change are also tightly entwined phenomena, feeding each other. as one gets worse, the other is prone to intensify as well. you have specifically a double burden. so countries affected by conflict are also, to a large degree, highly exposed to climate change, making life for the population incredibly difficult, said mr florian krampe, director of studies, peace and development at the stockholm international peace research institute. baku organisers have called for cop29 to be a truce cop and coincide with a one-month global ceasefire, while it will also emphasise peace as a significant theme for the first time. article 6 of the paris agreement has been a lingering issue for nearly a decade now. it covers the rules and frameworks for international carbon markets, which can be used by countries to meet emissions-reductions targets and make achieving those goals cheaper. at cop29, facilitators are hoping to finalise the mechanisms that can then lead buying and selling of carbon credits under a set framework. for instance, highly polluting countries could purchase credits - permissions to emit more than otherwise permitted - from countries that have gained extra credits from measures such as restoring their rainforests. some of these initiatives are already underway in pilot form or through regional or bilateral agreements. singapore has signed bilateral carbon offset trading agreements with both papua new guinea and ghana. for the first time, delegation heads will be involved in article 6 talks directly, an indication of the emphasis on finally concluding negotiations on this matter, which have been ongoing since the paris agreement was signed in 2015. right now globally, there is a lack of rigour and centralised multilateral frameworks on how carbon markets work. that has stifled the flow of money into them and given rise to schemes that do not drive real emissions reductions, akin to greenwashing. negotiations are complex, technical and political. issues such as unclear methodologies for counting credits, reporting rules and the risks of double counting credits have all combined to slow down progress on this key article.",1

children riding a single mobility scooter on a public road outside anchorpoint mall. the video drew widespread criticism online, with many saying that such misuse of personal mobility aids (pmas) by the able-bodied have become commonplace. they lamented that delivery riders seeking to bypass regulations on other transport modes are frequent culprits too. while mobility scooters provide independence to many seniors and disabled individuals, their misuse by those without mobility issues isnt just about public nuisances it poses a serious risk. pma-related accidents are becoming more frequent, with nine off-road cases recorded in the first half of 2024 alone, compared with 16 such accidents in all of 2023. legitimate users, reliant on others to use pmas safely around them, are exposed to danger when misusers treat mobility scooters as if they are go-karts. errant riders have also tainted the public image of pmas, causing some to view them largely as a bane. if unchecked, such stigma could spur backlash against pmas very presence in public spaces. how can we ensure pmas do not become an endangerment to public safety, without hindering accessibility to such aids for those with genuine mobility difficulties? there are mainly three types of pmas manual wheelchairs, motorised wheelchairs and mobility scooters. out of these, mobility scooters are in the spotlight for growing concern over their increasing misuse by able-bodied persons, as observed by the active mobility advisory panel in 2023. new ministry of transport rules, effective 2025, mandate that individuals seeking to use mobility scooters be certified by doctors to have health or physical conditions requiring their use. answering parliamentary questions on sep 10, 2024, minister for transport chee hong tat said the authorities have collaborated with healthcare providers, government agencies, and welfare groups to streamline the medical certification process for mobility scooter users. the focus is on making the system more user-friendly for those who truly need mobility aids while also preventing unnecessary strain on healthcare facilities. safety too is being stepped up, with the maximum allowed speed of pmas being lowered from 10kmh currently to 6kmh. this figure takes reference from normal walking speeds and will still allow pma users to cross roads safely, just as pedestrians do. size restrictions for pmas used on public paths will also be aligned with existing dimensional limits for pmas on public transport (70cm width, 120cm length, 150cm height, 300kg weight limit), with exceptions granted on a case-by-case basis for users with certified medical needs. aside from the new regulations, its worth considering if enforcement against those who use pmas without legitimate need or reckless pma users should also be stepped up in terms of frequency and visibility. more regular patrols and speed traps could be implemented, especially in areas with heavy pma traffic such as neighbourhood centres, parks and shopping districts. closed-circuit cameras deployed in these hotspots can leverage video analytics to automatically detect and flag violations. well-publicised enforcement blitzes would send an unequivocal deterrent message. rigorous upstream import controls and inspections of retailers (both physical and online) are also key to choking non-compliant supply, backed by stiffer penalties such as licence revocations for selling mobility scooters to those without disability. tracking devices and systems enabling remote monitoring and mandatory speed limiters could greatly facilitate enforcement. such trackers could be installed during the initial registration process of pmas with the land transport authority. public education is also paramount. many users may be unaware their pma usage is improper, or puts others at risk. food delivery companies, for example, must proactively steer able-bodied delivery riders towards making food deliveries on bicycles instead. when it comes to indoor spaces, navigating a mobility scooter through crowded, narrow corridors with high foot traffic still presents dangers, even at slower speeds. accidental collisions can easily result in injuries, especially for more vulnerable shoppers and patrons like young children and the elderly. some argue that malls should just ban pmas outright. however, this would unacceptably exclude disabled people and seniors from shopping centres, which are hubs of economic and social activity for all. the right to patronise shops, meet with friends and live an engaged life cannot be restricted only able-bodied. additional innovative solutions need to be pioneered to enable safer sharing of interior spaces between pmas and pedestrians. some that merit investigation compulsory low-speed zones with stricter limits, separate designated lanes, go-slow checkpoints, and more spacious pathways. a leaf could be taken out of funans book, with its 200m indoor cycling path. these malls could also be explicitly designated as pma-friendly. built-in speed limiters for motorised pmas could also have further speed-dampening settings that automatically kick in when indoors we already have the technology to make this work. however, this would also require extensive infrastructure in all indoor spaces to be effective. a simple low-tech option would be to require pma users to manually switch their device to an indoor mode with a lower speed limit when entering a building but the effectiveness of this would be dependent on user compliance and initiative. the significant momentum of heavy mobility scooters makes collisions uniquely hazardous. for victims, the costs of medical treatment and repairs can be financially ruinous. many pma users, often from lower-income groups like the elderly, may lack the means to pay out of pocket. mandating liability insurance would guarantee compensation for those harmed. compulsory coverage could also spur more responsible riding behaviour by pma users. the risk of future premium hikes or policy voidance for unsafe conduct could deter reckless practices such as speeding. crucially, liability protection for pma users themselves could also forestall potential public calls for draconian bans on these devices. mandatory policies may help preserve access for the disabled by mitigating the fallout for victims and the uninsured. however, this would place additional financial burden on lower-income pma users. to mitigate this, the government could consider providing need-based subsidies or allowing the costs to be paid through small instalments or medisave. means-tested coverage for disabled pma users should be pegged significantly lower than regular vehicles, reflecting their lower usage and risk exposure. the abuse and misuse of pmas must be comprehensively addressed but any enforcement and education drive must be careful not to impede the disabled.

over their increasing misuse by able-bodied persons, as observed by the active mobility advisory panel in 2023. new ministry of transport rules, effective 2025, mandate that individuals seeking to use mobility scooters be certified by doctors to have health or physical conditions requiring their use. answering parliamentary questions on sep 10, 2024, minister for transport chee hong tat said the authorities have collaborated with healthcare providers, government agencies, and welfare groups to streamline the medical certification process for mobility scooter users. the focus is on making the system more user-friendly for those who truly need mobility aids while also preventing unnecessary strain on healthcare facilities. safety too is being stepped up, with the maximum allowed speed of pmas being lowered from 10kmh currently to 6kmh. this figure takes reference from normal walking speeds and will still allow pma users to cross roads safely, just as pedestrians do. size restrictions for pmas used on public paths will also be aligned with existing dimensional limits for pmas on public transport (70cm width, 120cm length, 150cm height, 300kg weight limit), with exceptions granted on a case-by-case basis for users with certified medical needs. aside from the new regulations, its worth considering if enforcement against those who use pmas without legitimate need or reckless pma users should also be stepped up in terms of frequency and visibility. more regular patrols and speed traps could be implemented, especially in areas with heavy pma traffic such as neighbourhood centres, parks and shopping districts. closed-circuit cameras deployed in these hotspots can leverage video analytics to automatically detect and flag violations. well-publicised enforcement blitzes would send an unequivocal deterrent message. rigorous upstream import controls and inspections of retailers (both physical and online) are also key to choking non-compliant supply, backed by stiffer penalties such as licence revocations for selling mobility scooters to those without disability. tracking devices and systems enabling remote monitoring and mandatory speed limiters could greatly facilitate enforcement. such trackers could be installed during the initial registration process of pmas with the land transport authority. public education is also paramount. many users may be unaware their pma usage is improper, or puts others at risk. food delivery companies, for example, must proactively steer able-bodied delivery riders towards making food deliveries on bicycles instead. when it comes to indoor spaces, navigating a mobility scooter through crowded, narrow corridors with high foot traffic still presents dangers, even at slower speeds. accidental collisions can easily result in injuries, especially for more vulnerable shoppers and patrons like young children and the elderly. some argue that malls should just ban pmas outright. however, this would unacceptably exclude disabled people and seniors from shopping centres, which are hubs of economic and social activity for all. the right to patronise shops, meet with friends and live an engaged life cannot be restricted only able-bodied. additional innovative solutions need to be pioneered to enable safer sharing of interior spaces between pmas and pedestrians. some that merit investigation compulsory low-speed zones with stricter limits, separate designated lanes, go-slow checkpoints, and more spacious pathways. a leaf could be taken out of funans book, with its 200m indoor cycling

indoors we already have the technology to make this work. however, this would also require extensive infrastructure in all indoor spaces to be effective. a simple low-tech option would be to require pma users to manually switch their device to an indoor mode with a lower speed limit when entering a building but the effectiveness of this would be dependent on user compliance and initiative. the significant momentum of heavy mobility scooters makes collisions uniquely hazardous. for victims, the costs of medical treatment and repairs can be financially ruinous. many pma users, often from lower-income groups like the elderly, may lack the means to pay out of pocket. mandating liability insurance would guarantee compensation for those harmed. compulsory coverage could also spur more responsible riding behaviour by pma users. the risk of future premium hikes or policy voidance for unsafe conduct could deter reckless practices such as speeding. crucially, liability protection for

individuals seeking to use mobility scooters be certified by doctors to have health or physical conditions requiring their use. answering parliamentary questions on sep 10, 2024, minister for transport chee hong tat said the authorities have collaborated with healthcare providers, government agencies, and welfare groups to streamline the medical certification process for mobility scooter users. the focus is on making the system more user-friendly for those who truly need mobility aids while also preventing unnecessary strain on healthcare facilities. safety too is being stepped up, with the maximum allowed speed of pmas being lowered from 10kmh currently to 6kmh. this figure takes reference from normal walking speeds and will still allow pma users to cross roads safely, just as pedestrians do. size restrictions for pmas used on public paths will also be aligned with existing dimensional limits for pmas on public transport (70cm width, 120cm length, 150cm height, 300kg weight limit), with exceptions granted on a case-by-case basis for users with certified medical needs. aside from the new regulations, its worth considering if enforcement against those who use pmas without legitimate need or reckless pma users should also be stepped up in terms of frequency and visibility. more regular patrols and speed traps could be implemented, especially in areas with heavy pma traffic such as neighbourhood centres, parks and shopping districts. closed-circuit cameras deployed in these hotspots can leverage video analytics to automatically detect and flag violations. well-publicised enforcement blitzes would send an unequivocal deterrent message. rigorous upstream import controls and inspections of retailers (both physical and online) are also key to choking non-compliant supply, backed by stiffer penalties such as licence revocations for selling mobility scooters to those without disability. tracking devices and systems enabling remote monitoring and mandatory speed limiters could greatly facilitate enforcement. such trackers could be installed during the initial registration process of pmas with the land transport authority. public education is also paramount. many users may be unaware their pma usage is improper, or puts others at risk. food delivery companies, for example, must proactively steer able-bodied delivery riders towards making food deliveries on bicycles instead. when it comes to indoor spaces, navigating a mobility scooter through crowded, narrow corridors with high foot traffic still presents dangers, even at slower speeds. accidental collisions can easily result in injuries, especially for more vulnerable shoppers and patrons like young children and the elderly. some argue that malls should just ban pmas outright. however, this would unacceptably exclude disabled people and seniors from shopping centres, which are hubs of economic and social activity for all. the right to patronise shops, meet with friends and live an engaged life cannot be restricted only able-bodied. additional innovative solutions need to be pioneered to enable safer sharing of interior spaces between pmas and pedestrians. some that merit investigation compulsory low-speed zones with stricter limits, separate designated lanes, go-slow checkpoints, and more spacious pathways. a leaf could be taken out of funans book, with its 200m indoor cycling path. these malls could also be explicitly designated as pma-friendly. built-in speed limiters for motorised pmas could also have further speed-dampening settings that automatically kick in when indoors we already have the technology to make this work. however, this would also require extensive infrastructure in all indoor spaces to be effective. a simple low-tech option would be to require pma users to manually switch their device to an indoor mode with a lower speed limit when entering a building but the effectiveness of this would be dependent on user compliance and initiative. the significant momentum of heavy mobility scooters makes collisions uniquely hazardous. for victims, the costs of medical treatment and repairs can be financially ruinous. many pma users, often from lower-income groups like the elderly, may lack the means to pay out of pocket. mandating liability insurance would guarantee compensation for those harmed. compulsory coverage could also spur more responsible riding behaviour by pma users. the risk of future premium hikes or policy voidance for unsafe conduct could deter reckless practices such as speeding. crucially, liability protection for pma users themselves could also forestall potential public calls for draconian bans on these devices. mandatory policies may help preserve access for the disabled by mitigating the fallout for victims and the uninsured. however, this would place additional financial burden on lower-income pma users. to mitigate this, the government could consider providing need-based subsidies or allowing the costs to be paid through small instalments or medisave. means-tested coverage for disabled pma users should be pegged significantly lower than regular vehicles, reflecting their lower usage and risk exposure. the abuse and misuse of pmas must be comprehensively addressed but any enforcement and education drive must be careful not to impede the disabled. nevertheless, rules and regulations are merely a complement to building a more gracious and accommodating social culture. pma riders need to recognise that their choice of mobility aid comes with responsibilities. public education campaigns should emphasise not just the rules, but the rationale to protect access for the disabled and safety for everyone. ben chester cheong is a law lecturer and

with the maximum allowed speed of pmas being lowered from 10kmh currently to 6kmh. this figure takes reference from normal walking speeds and will still allow pma users to cross roads safely, just as

traffic such as neighbourhood centres, parks and shopping districts. closed-circuit cameras deployed in these hotspots can leverage video analytics to automatically detect and flag violations.

to many seniors and disabled individuals, their misuse by those without mobility issues isnt just about public nuisances it poses a serious risk. pma-related accidents are becoming more frequent, with nine off-road cases recorded in the first half of 2024 alone, compared with 16 such accidents in all of 2023. legitimate users, reliant on others to use pmas safely around them, are exposed to danger

mobility difficulties? there are mainly three types of pmas manual wheelchairs, motorised wheelchairs and mobility scooters. out of these, mobility scooters are in the spotlight for growing concern over their increasing misuse by able-bodied persons, as observed by the active mobility advisory panel in 2023. new ministry of transport rules, effective 2025, mandate that individuals seeking to use mobility scooters be certified by doctors to have health or physical conditions requiring their use. answering parliamentary questions on sep 10, 2024, minister for transport chee hong tat said the authorities have collaborated with healthcare providers, government agencies, and welfare groups to streamline the medical certification process for mobility scooter users. the focus is on making the system more user-friendly for those who truly need mobility aids while also preventing unnecessary strain on healthcare facilities. safety too is being stepped up, with the maximum allowed speed of pmas being lowered from 10kmh currently to 6kmh. this figure takes reference from normal walking speeds and will still allow pma users to cross roads safely, just as pedestrians do. size restrictions for pmas used on public paths will also be aligned with existing dimensional limits for pmas on public transport (70cm width, 120cm length, 150cm height, 300kg weight limit), with exceptions granted on a case-by-case basis for users with certified medical needs. aside from the new regulations, its worth considering if enforcement against those who use pmas without legitimate need or reckless pma users should also be stepped up in terms of frequency and visibility. more regular patrols and speed traps could be implemented, especially in areas with heavy pma traffic such as neighbourhood centres, parks and shopping districts. closed-circuit cameras deployed in these hotspots can leverage video analytics to automatically detect and flag violations. well-publicised enforcement blitzes would send an unequivocal deterrent message. rigorous upstream import controls and inspections of retailers (both physical and online) are also key to choking non-compliant supply, backed by stiffer penalties such as licence revocations for selling mobility scooters to those without disability. tracking devices and systems enabling remote monitoring and mandatory speed limiters could greatly facilitate enforcement. such trackers could be installed during the initial registration process of pmas with the land transport authority. public education is also paramount. many users may be unaware their pma usage is improper, or puts others at risk. food delivery companies, for example, must proactively steer able-bodied delivery riders towards making food deliveries on bicycles instead. when it comes to indoor spaces, navigating a mobility scooter through crowded, narrow corridors with high foot traffic still presents dangers, even at slower speeds. accidental collisions can easily result in injuries, especially for more vulnerable shoppers and patrons like young children and the elderly. some argue that malls should just ban pmas outright. however, this would unacceptably exclude disabled people and seniors from shopping centres, which are hubs of economic and social activity for all. the right to patronise shops, meet with friends and live an engaged life cannot be restricted only able-bodied. additional innovative solutions need to be pioneered to enable safer sharing of interior spaces between pmas and pedestrians. some that merit investigation compulsory low-speed zones with stricter limits, separate designated lanes, go-slow checkpoints, and more spacious pathways. a leaf could be taken out of funans book, with its 200m indoor cycling

indoors we already have the technology to make this work. however, this would also require extensive infrastructure in all indoor spaces to be effective. a simple low-tech option would be to require pma users to manually switch their device to an indoor mode with a lower speed limit when entering a building but the effectiveness of this would be dependent on user compliance and initiative. the

exposed to danger when misusers treat mobility scooters as if they are go-karts. errant riders have also tainted the public image of pmas, causing some to view them largely as a bane. if unchecked, such stigma could spur backlash against pmas very presence in public spaces. how can we ensure pmas do not become an endangerment to public safety, without hindering accessibility to such aids for those with genuine mobility difficulties? there are mainly three types of pmas manual wheelchairs, motorised wheelchairs and mobility scooters. out of these, mobility scooters are in the spotlight for growing concern over their increasing misuse by able-bodied persons, as observed by the active mobility advisory panel in 2023. new ministry of transport rules, effective 2025, mandate that individuals seeking to use mobility scooters be certified by doctors to have health or physical conditions requiring their use. answering parliamentary questions on sep 10, 2024, minister for transport chee hong tat said the authorities have collaborated with healthcare providers, government agencies, and welfare groups to streamline the medical certification process for mobility scooter users. the focus is on making the system more user-friendly for those who truly need mobility aids while also preventing unnecessary strain on healthcare facilities. safety too is being stepped up, with the maximum allowed speed of pmas being lowered from 10kmh currently to 6kmh. this figure takes reference from normal walking speeds and will still allow pma users to cross roads safely, just as pedestrians do. size restrictions for pmas used on public paths will also be aligned with existing dimensional limits for pmas on public transport (70cm width, 120cm length, 150cm height, 300kg weight limit), with exceptions granted on a case-by-case basis for users with certified medical needs. aside from the new regulations, its worth considering if enforcement against those who use pmas without legitimate need or reckless pma users should also be stepped up in terms of frequency and visibility. more regular patrols and speed traps could be implemented, especially in areas with heavy pma traffic such as neighbourhood centres, parks and shopping districts. closed-circuit cameras deployed in these hotspots can leverage video analytics to automatically detect and flag violations. well-publicised enforcement blitzes would send an unequivocal deterrent message. rigorous upstream import controls and inspections of retailers (both physical and online) are also key to choking non-compliant supply, backed by stiffer penalties such as licence revocations for selling mobility scooters to those without disability. tracking devices and systems enabling remote monitoring and mandatory speed limiters could greatly facilitate enforcement. such trackers could be installed during the initial registration process of pmas with the land transport authority. public education is also paramount. many users may be unaware their pma usage is improper, or puts others at risk. food delivery companies, for example, must proactively steer able-bodied delivery riders towards making food deliveries on bicycles instead. when it comes to indoor spaces, navigating a mobility scooter through crowded, narrow corridors with high foot traffic still presents dangers, even at slower speeds. accidental collisions can easily result in injuries, especially for more vulnerable shoppers and patrons like young children and the elderly. some argue that malls should just ban pmas outright. however, this would unacceptably exclude disabled people and seniors from shopping centres, which are hubs of economic and social activity for all. the right to patronise shops, meet with friends and live an engaged life cannot be restricted only able-bodied. additional innovative solutions need to be pioneered to enable safer sharing of interior spaces between pmas and pedestrians. some that merit investigation compulsory low-speed zones with stricter limits, separate designated lanes, go-slow checkpoints, and more spacious pathways. a leaf could be taken out of funans book, with its 200m indoor cycling path. these malls could also be explicitly designated as pma-friendly. built-in speed limiters for motorised pmas could also have further speed-dampening settings that automatically kick in when indoors we already have the technology to make this work. however, this would also require extensive infrastructure in all indoor spaces to be effective. a simple low-tech option would be to require pma users to manually switch their device to an indoor mode with a lower speed limit when entering a building but the effectiveness of this would be dependent on user compliance and initiative. the significant momentum of heavy mobility scooters makes collisions uniquely hazardous. for victims, the costs of medical treatment and repairs can be financially ruinous. many pma users, often from lower-income groups like the elderly, may lack the means to pay out of pocket. mandating liability insurance would guarantee compensation for those harmed. compulsory coverage could also spur more responsible riding behaviour by pma users. the risk of future premium hikes or policy voidance for unsafe conduct could deter reckless practices such as speeding. crucially, liability protection for pma users themselves could also forestall potential public calls for draconian bans on these devices. mandatory policies may help preserve access for the disabled by mitigating the fallout for victims and the uninsured. however, this would place additional financial burden on lower-income pma users. to mitigate this, the government could consider providing need-based subsidies or allowing the costs to be paid through small instalments or medisave. means-tested coverage for disabled pma users should be pegged significantly lower than regular vehicles, reflecting their lower usage and risk exposure. the abuse and misuse of pmas must be comprehensively addressed but any enforcement and education drive must be careful not to impede the disabled. nevertheless, rules and regulations are merely a complement to building a more gracious and accommodating social culture. pma riders need to recognise that their choice of mobility aid comes with responsibilities. public education campaigns should emphasise not just the rules, but the rationale to protect access for the disabled and safety for everyone. ben chester cheong is a law lecturer and

rules,CNA,Politics,Government Policies,11/3/2024 14:53,1.3335251,103.959537,Expo,"singapore a rocky road lies ahead for sino-us ties regardless of who emerges as america's next leader, but the size of the rocks and which areas they lie in will vary depending on whether a harris or trump presidency emerges, say analysts. they add that for all their disagreements, one thing both republicans and democrats agree on, even before the polarising and deadlocked presidential contest, is the need to counter china. this wont change, whether its vice-president kamala harris or former president donald trump who takes office. observers say this stance will colour washingtons approach towards beijing - a reality well recognised by the chinese leadership. strategic patience is beijing's only choice in dealing with washington, regardless of whether it's trump or harris, mr einar tangen, a senior fellow at the beijing-based taihe institute, told cna. trade, tech and taiwan are the hot-button issues looming large over the bilateral relationship, with far-reaching global consequences depending on how they are handled, experts warn. dr william choong, a senior fellow at iseas-yusof ishak institute, told cna that clarity on americas china policies is a key want from beijing. if the chinese had their wish, theyd wish that all these trade curbs and tech export controls went away. but we know that's not going to go away, he said. competition and confrontation have been gaining ground in recent years, at the expense of cooperation in the sino-us relationship. competition, in particular, has effectively become a structural condition of their ties, say analysts. a landmark sino-us scientific cooperation treaty slipped away without renewal in late august for the first time in 45 years. meanwhile, both sides have been locking horns on an expanding list of issues, centred on themes like national security. analysts expect this trend to persist regardless of a harris or trump win in the us presidential election. americans head polls on nov 5 to choose between mr trump, gunning for a second term, and ms harris, who replaced president joe biden on the democratic party ticket just over two months ago. (a trump or harris win is) two roads same cliff, said mr tangen. similarly, mr steven okun, senior advisor from the public affairs consultancy firm apac advisors, told cna that whoever takes the oval office will not have directional change in china policy. us-china policy will be the same under either a harris or trump administration. there will be more tariffs and more investment restrictions, he said. both presidential contenders have already made clear what they think about china. i will make sure that america, not china, wins the competition for the 21st century, pledged ms harris in late august when she accepted the democratic nomination for the presidency. meanwhile, her republican rival mr trump - who launched a trade war against china while in the white house from 2017 to 2021 - has vowed to get even tougher on china and completely eliminate dependence on the country of 1.4 billion people. china is clear-eyed on this - and sees a trump or harris presidency as determining the degree of containment towards the worlds no 2 economy, said dr chen dongxiao, a senior research fellow and president of the shanghai institutes for international studies (siis), at a recent public lecture in singapore. dr chen highlighted that in the event of a trump victory, he would have another four years in office without the pressure of re-election. under american law, a us president can only serve two terms. he explained that this would be of concern to china, as mr trump will have more space and potential to mobilise federal agencies in order to serve his confrontational, anti-china containment policy and measures. china is not expected to publicly state or even allude to who it wants as americas next leader, observers have noted, because it does not want to be accused of interference in the us election. chinese officials have repeatedly stated the us presidential election is the americans internal affair. they dont have a vote. they do have a preference. but when they dont get their preference, they have to work with whoever occupies the oval office in the white house, said dr choong on beijings perspective, based on his conversations with chinese academics. professor jia qingguo, former dean of the school of international studies at peking university and a senior member of chinas top political advisory body, believes what matters is whether the incumbent or opposition partys candidate comes up top, with the first scenario - in this case, a harris presidency - being more beneficial for beijing. the reason is in a presidential election, the opposition party would condemn or has to condemn the ruling partys policies. when it comes to (policies on china), invariably the opposition party candidate would condemn the ruling party for being too soft on china, and then they would vow to make some changes, he explained at a recent conference in singapore. when they get elected, they would have to honour some of their campaign promises - whether they are realistic or not - and (when trying to do so), the relationship would be in trouble, he added. prof jia also highlighted the potential for miscommunication during the presidential transition as some tacit understandings might not be passed on, potentially adding friction between the chinese government and the new us administration. in the us, a presidential transition is a formal process where a president-elect takes over the administration of the federal government from the incumbent president, giving the incoming leader and their team time to prepare for governance. conversely, a win by the incumbent party candidate - in this case, ms harris - would likely mean a smoother transition and some level of policy continuity - predictability that beijing is likely to favour, he suggested. dr choong said trade, tech and taiwan are at the heart of us-china tensions - and how americas next leader addresses these three issues, especially the last, determines not just the trajectory of bilateral ties, but whether competition and confrontation could boil over into conflict. on trade, the us has been taking action to curb what it has described as unfair practices by china, hiking tariffs on chinese imports ranging from steel to electric vehicles. beijing has consistently denied the allegations and accused the us of trying to contain it. a second trump term would see tariffs taking pride of place in americas economic policy, as the man himself has all but proclaimed. to me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariffs, mr trump said in an october interview with bloomberg news. the businessman-turned-politician has signalled a 10 to 20 per cent blanket tariff on all imports under his watch, with the rate upwards of 60 per cent on goods from china. some tariff measures under the biden administration were carried forward from the first trump term. should she win the election, ms harris is likely to retain many of these elements, including targeted tariffs as well as working with partners and allies from a military security perspective, noted mr okun, who served in the bill clinton administration. while china would obviously like to see us tariffs gone, its resigned fact they will remain in some shape or form beyond the nov 5 poll, said dr choong, who is also the managing editor of the iseas-yusof ishak institute's fulcrum commentary website. tech is another sticking point in sino-us relations. the biden administration has kept up what it has termed a small yard, high fence approach to restrict chinese access to key technologies, for reasons of national security. small yard refers to a small group of technologies and research deemed critical to us national security, while high fence signifies strict containment measures on them. this strategy leaves room for engagement with china beyond this perimeter. but observers have pointed out that the yard has been growing bigger and the fence getting higher. (the measures) now include export controls, inward and outbound investment controls, and vendor monitoring and reporting obligations that cover a growing list of technologies, mr john lee, the director of consultancy east west futures and a researcher at the leiden asia centre, noted in a february article. on oct 28, us officials announced new rules, banning us-headquartered firms, citizens, and permanent residents from investing in chinese technology like semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, with effect from jan 2 next year. dr choong shared that based on his conversations with the chinese, many see the expanding measures as a new reality. what they seek is clarity on the exact scope of the policy so as to work around it, he noted. (the chinese) are saying we dont care if its going to be a small yard or big yard. just tell us what the boundaries of the yard actually are. i think thats a pretty reasonable request, he said. then theres taiwan, the self-ruled island china considers an inalienable part of its territory. beijing has repeatedly underscored it will not tolerate any internal or external attempts towards taiwan independence. chinese president xi jinping has framed the issue as the bedrock of the political foundation of china-us relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in bilateral ties. cross-strait tensions are at their highest in recent years. chinese military sorties around the self-ruled island have become a near-daily occurrence. major drills just last month simulated a blockade and assaults on maritime and ground targets. the us has long followed a policy of strategic ambiguity regarding taiwan, being intentionally vague about how it would support taiwan should china attempt a takeover. this has provided space for future resolution of the issue, mr okun observed. there has been no indication that any of the three parties (the us, china, and taiwan) are looking for an immediate change status quo within the us-china bilateral relationship from their respective positions, he added. on broader security issues, including that of taiwan, dr choong noted that a harris presidency would continue emphasising alliances and partnerships to deter china. this will also continue to irritate china to no end, simply because the chinese feel that they are being hemmed in, he said. in contrast, for a trump 2.0 presidency, dr choong sees a big question mark, saying that the former president has a short attention span. mr trump has made several comments on the campaign trail that taiwan should pay to be protected, and accused the island of stealing us semiconductor business. some of the comments made on taiwan, whether it's actually worth the candle on (the island), who knows? it really depends on the day or the month that we are raising that question, remarked dr choong. whichever way the chips fall in the race for the white house, analysts say southeast asia will feel the ripples considering the regions strategic importance in the us-china rivalry. should mr trump emerge victorious and make good on his tariff threat, aside from hurting american consumers and businesses, the international economy would be roiled as other countries retaliate, the non-partisan us think tank peterson institute for international economics warned in june. be it a trump or harris presidency, analysts point out that their respective administration members will have a major hand in shaping policies. more so for the us than most governments, personnel is policy, said mr okun from apac advisors. he explained that while the white house determines the overall direction, presidential appointees have large sway in determining administration policy due to a hefty government thats involved in nearly every global issue. in terms of washingtons policies towards beijing, key positions to look out for are secretary of state, treasury secretary, the us trade representative and national security advisor, mr okun said. for example, current secretary of state blinken has been at the forefront of sino-us engagements, making two visits to beijing in the past two years and meeting top chinese leaders, including president xi. treasury secretary janet yellen has similarly made trips to china to express concerns over overcapacity. while neither mr trump nor ms harris has explicitly stated their cabinet lineup should they take the oval office, potential picks have already surfaced in the lead-up. both sides have also hinted at a baseline criteria. a senior official in trumps campaign told the financial times early last month that any appointees to a second trump administration would need to prove fidelity and loyalty. meanwhile, continuity aside, ms harris is also looking towards a younger, more diverse lineup, us media outlet politico has reported. mr okun believes trump will prioritise appointees who are loyal to him if he gets a second stint in the oval office. consequently, these loyalists are more likely to back his more aggressive stance against china. his national security team could range from being hawkish in china within the existing relationship to one that could push for a further decoupling of the two economies, he said. for china, the landscape is considerably different. while foreign minister wang yi has been the leading diplomat on the frontline, power is effectively centralised around mr xi as the core of the leadership, observers note. mr wang became the countrys top diplomat in january last year when he was appointed as the director of the office of the central foreign affairs commission of chinas communist party (ccp). at the same time, the work of policymaking is done by think tanks and government commissions that assess the landscape and make recommendations, shared mr tangen from taihe institute. (president xi) is credited with the strategy, but the policies are the result of hundreds of thousands of hours of study and debate in contrast to many developed nations where policies are based on the political winds, mr tangen remarked, without specifying which countries he was referring to. he added that at the end of the day, both china and the us need to understand that mutual cooperation is the best way forward - the challenge is making sure both sides are aligned in mindset and execution. mr tangen referenced the prisoners dilemma, a thought experiment where two parties are separated and unable to communicate. one side benefits if it betrays the other, but working together can yield better collective results. china and the us are not the only actors in the world, but as the leading economies they have a duty to learn and accept their differences and work together towards a shared future, not one that prioritises one above all, he said.",1
rules,CNA,Technology,Artificial Intelligence,11/2/2024 15:11,1.3335251,103.959537,Expo,"johor bahru malaysia has welcomed major investments by semiconductor firms, data centre operators and other tech players in recent years. but its companies are now jittery over the possibility of more tariffs by the united states in its trade war and artificial intelligence (ai) race with china. like its southeast asian neighbours vietnam, thailand and cambodia, malaysia may need to brace itself for harsher tariffs should former us president donald trump win the nov 5 presidential election, experts say, even as greater us protectionism is here to stay no matter who becomes its next leader. the four southeast asian states are among those that have gained from the china plus one strategy by companies to diversify their supply chains to avoid us tariffs on goods from china. the us-china trade war began in 2018 over what the us dubbed unfair trade practices by china. the phenomenon has also been termed southeast asia-washing, which refers to chinese companies trying to disguise the origin of their products by relocating operations to countries in the region. this month, the us began imposing duties on solar imports from the four countries, which host factories set up by chinese companies such as jinko solar and trina solar. under the new tariff regime, malaysian solar equipment exported us will incur a 9.13 per cent duty. those from thailand will incur a 23.06 per cent duty, while the rate is 2.85 per cent for vietnam and 8.25 per cent for cambodia. the rates, which are preliminary and lower than what some experts had expected, are what the us commerce department has calculated to be subsidies for their production. the us tariffs have cast a pall over the sector in malaysia, according to industry insiders, while bloomberg reported in late-august that at least three chinese solar companies have scaled back operations in thailand, vietnam and malaysia. mr ken ong, managing director of malaysian solar firm helios photovoltaic, told cna he understands that some chinese firms in malaysia are stalling expansion plans following the new tariffs. a local official at kulim hi-tech park an industrial facility in the northern state of kedah said chinese solar firm risen technology has taken precautions to reduce production output by temporarily ceasing one line of production. the official, who declined to be named, added that the firm was also looking for a new market to ship its products. cna has contacted risen for confirmation. jinko solar has reportedly shut its penang facility and retrenched workers, while the founder of longi green energy technology co was quoted in june voicing concerns over the industrys future in southeast asia. there are concerns that us tariffs could be extended to malaysias semiconductor industry and could also put a dent on its burgeoning data centre industry. washington announced on tuesday (oct 29) that it has finalised restrictions on investments by us individuals and companies in advanced technology from china, including semiconductors, quantum computing and ai. the restrictions ban some investments in those industries and require the us government to be notified about others. the us seeks to curb chinas access to high-end chips and other advanced technologies that could help it develop critical technologies for a military edge. malaysias semiconductor industry has gained from companies china plus one strategy and it has attracted multi-billion dollar investments from leading firms such as intel and infineon in recent years. chinese firms have also set up there and in april, three firms china wafer level csp, ningbo sj electronics and wuxi amte inc announced plans to invest a combined us$100 million in the northern state of penang, which has been dubbed the silicon valley of the east. malaysia now accounts for 13 per cent of global chip testing and packaging. mr wong siew hai, president of the malaysia semiconductor industry association, is concerned the sector could soon be stalled by us restrictions. in may, the us said it would increase tariffs on chinese semiconductors from 25 per cent to 50 per cent by 2025 as part of measures to boost the us capacity to manufacture semiconductors domestically. these chinese companies have aspirations to make sure that their products can be sold and they want to sell it rest of the world but there is this china-phobia now (in the us), and this has nothing to do with national security anymore, said mr wong. we have to start getting used to this restrictions and tariffs from the us. it has (started) and its not going to stop. but he does not expect chinese semiconductor companies in malaysia such as tf amd microelectronics, which has built a rm2 billion facility in penang, to stall operations because of potential sanctions. i doubt they will hold back and (move operations) because this china phobia will persist (anywhere they shift to), he said. other experts, however, say there could be an impact on malaysias data centres. owing to abundant land and cheaper power, including in the southern state of johor, major data centre players like nvidia, airtrunk, gds international, ytl power as well as princeton digital group have set up operations recently, and tech giant microsoft has reportedly purchased land to open a data centre. data centre expert gary goh told cna that potential investors, be they chinese or from the west, would be watching the us election closely and monitoring any subsequent sanctions related to computing and ai. if there are signs that exports of advanced chips to third countries like malaysia are also limited, data centre firms will be more cautious in expansion a cautious wait-and-see approach is the natural step to take, said mr goh. amid industry disquiet, the malaysian government is engaging the us commerce department to delay any implementation of tariffs and lend support to impacted companies. speaking to cna on the sidelines of a media briefing on tuesday, malaysias minister of investment, trade and industry tengku zafrul abdul aziz said we are now helping the affected companies by getting more information and asking for more time to do so, as well as engaging with the us commerce department to see how we can support these companies. experts believe the us will continue to act against chinas trade practices, no matter who becomes its next president. under a trump administration, however, measures are likely to be more aggressive and abrupt, they say. the us will increase scrutiny over trade with southeast asian countries regardless of the election outcome, said mr chim lee, senior analyst with the economist intelligence unit. in other words, as supply chains become chinaone, tariffs are also becoming chinaone, he said. under trump, the us may escalate tariffs on imports from southeast asia in a harsher and more abrupt manner. it is likely to adopt a more transactional approach with regional governments, potentially demanding that southeast asian governments align more closely with the us on key security and geopolitical issues in exchange for tariff exemptions, added mr lee. in a report released on wednesday, singapore-headquartered bank ocbc said that under a second trump presidency, six southeast asian countries malaysia, singapore, indonesia, thailand, vietnam and the philippines could be impacted if he follows through on his election promises of higher tariffs. mr steven okun, who is senior advisor singapore-headquartered consultancy apac advisors, told cna the us will work to ensure that china will not have us technology, goods or investment that would harm its national interest. as such, under either a (kamala) harris or trump administration, the us will continue expanding its efforts to protect national security when it comes to china, either directly or through third countries, added mr okun, who served as deputy general counsel at the us department of transportation under the clinton administration. however, ms harris and trump are likely to have different approaches issue, he said. ms harris is likely to continue current president joe bidens approach of working with partners and allies in advancing the us national interest through engagement in the asia-pacific. in contrast, a trump administrations america first approach would likely take a bilateral perspective and be driven by whether a country has a trade surplus or deficit with the us. for a country such as malaysia or vietnam which has a large trade surplus with the us, that will drive the us approach to much more so under a trump administration than a harris one, he added. us government data shows it notched a us$14 billion trade deficit with malaysia across the first eight months of this year, and a us$77 billion trade deficit with vietnam in the same period. its trade deficit with thailand was around us$28 billion. vietnam has been very successful in getting firms to look at locating some or all of their production processes in the country, explained trade expert deborah elms. as vietnam is well connected to key markets via free trade agreements, it has been an important spur to new inbound investment, said ms elms. some of this investment is currently coming from chinese firms looking to diversify their risks, lower production costs or avoid high tariffs that apply to goods directly shipping from china. in general, this should not pose a problem. of course, vietnam has to educate firms on the rules of these agreements so that firms are following the right steps to legally claim origin, said ms elms of the asian trade centre, a trade-related consultancy in singapore. however, if trump gets re-elected, vietnam (especially) may face a problem as trump is obsessed with the bilateral trade deficit numbers for goods. vietnam sends way more products us than the reverse and he is likely to want to stop this, she added. but american firms with sizeable business interests in, and with, china could wield some influence, believes dr oh ei sun, senior fellow at singapore institute of international affairs think tank. tariffs and sanctions could be routinely waived under heavy lobbying by such firms in the scenario of a second trump presidency, he said. it

parenting experts said that ideally mobile phones and tablets should not be introduced to children unless absolutely necessary. think many times before giving your children a gadget. if its not a school requirement, better delay it until the kids have a strong digital literacy, said mr jumh tantri, parenting coach from hesed psychotherapy international. acknowledging that for most parents that ship has sailed, experts advised incremental usage and finally ownership of such devices. dr jiow hee jhee, who is an associate professor at the singapore institute of technology researching the impact of digital media on families, said there needs to be a distinction between ownership and usage. let the children use the device purposefully for a few hours, then return the device parents. so start with usage, slowly build up and allow longer usage times, and train them to be responsible, said dr jiow, whose children started out using his spare mobile phones only when they needed to inform him when they were done with their co-curricular activities. if such devices are already a part of children's lives, parenting experts pointed out that screen time is not necessarily a bad thing if consumed in moderation and with a purpose. mr tantri considers two hours or less of screen time a healthy amount as long as a break is taken every 20 to 30 minutes. more than three hours, he pointed out, can lead to myopia, obesity and social isolation, among other issues. overall, parents need to ensure that their children are not neglecting their sleep time, oral hygiene, meal times, or intentionally holding in their urine just to use their devices. in addition to instilling time limitations, it is also advisable to demarcate tech-free areas in the home to help maintain a balance of screen-based and non-screen-based activities around the house, said mr tantri. another suggestion is to use separate devices for learning and entertainment. this way, there is a clear distinction between the devices which minimises distraction. parents should monitor learning devices to ensure that social media apps, games and other forms of entertainment are not installed there, added mr tantri. parenting experts said that nothing beats setting a positive example for children to model after, which means adults need to abide by these tech-free zones as well. ms ksther lim, 46, for example, made it a rule that mobile phones are not allowed at the dining table during meal times. setting a positive example also means showing children how they themselves have a healthy balance between online and offline worlds, said experts. this means showing them that entertainment does not have to come from a device after their childs screen time is up, parents should consider bringing them to public libraries, museums, and playgrounds or letting them do household chores. these make for great group activities that engage the different senses and activate different parts of the brain for great mental and physiological health, said mr tantri. parenting experts stressed the importance of open communication with their children from a young age about the use of such devices. among the questions parents can ask themselves are why are they overindulging in screen time? are they missing human connections and are hence seeking companionship by gaming and chatting with online friends? using this knowledge, mr tantri suggested that parents and children can then intentionally come up with rules together in terms of how they would like to balance online and offline time. to prevent future disputes, parents also need to be transparent in discussing the types of content that are allowed and actively engage in a dialogue about their childrens media consumption. digital wellness educator and family coach carol loi said discuss openly who your children are following on social media why are your children following these influencers and what they are learning from them. listen actively and be open to hearing their perspectives. building a culture of openness and transparency will reduce disagreements in the family because there will be a focus on how to journey life together. she added that when disagreements happen, they can focus on the values that the family holds dear. for example, they can talk about why or why not does a particular influencer create a positive impact on society. ms lim, who is a mother of a 15-year-old, said she has managed to cultivate this level of trust with her son who shows her his social media feed so that they can discuss what is trending and what he enjoys watching online. while she sometimes disagrees with the content that he is consuming, her son is receptive to a discussion on the issue. for instance, she wanted him to stop following a gaming youtuber's channel because the influencer used a significant amount of profanity in his speech. but her son reassured her that he would not start swearing like the youtuber. she kept a watchful eye on his language and since he kept his promise, she did not insist that he stop following that influencer. mr tantri emphasised that parents have to make their children see that any dialogue comes from a good place and that they do not want the kids to be disadvantaged by the consequences of irresponsible screen use. parents should also adapt rules at home as their children grow up. for example, 12-year-olds usually require close monitoring and sensitive communication in explaining strict rules, while 16-year-olds need less of that because they should understand the need for such rules and the consequences. beyond conversations and setting boundaries, parents can also turn to a few common applications to monitor their childrens screen activities including microsoft family safety and google family link. these applications allow parents to set screen time limits and filter any inappropriate content that may be harmful to children of a certain age group. parental control software however is not foolproof. teens may figure out ways to bypass parental control software by looking for loopholes on online discussion forums and those familiar with hacking through their experience in gaming and coding are also likely to know how to handle technical situations such as de-configuring the system, said mr tantri. tech blog editor alfred siew added that parents would do well to change up their passwords once in a while. he said that his children figured out the passwords of other adult family members mobile phones because the adults typed the passwords in front of the children. they did this many times. this is problematic because they are logged in as an adult and theres no parental controls, he said. dr jiow, who is a member of the media literacy council, added that one of his studies found that a child installed a video camera at a strategic location in the house and was able to see the parent typing in the password. it is not always easy to stay ahead of these techniques but mr tantri suggested that parents can start by thinking from the perspective of a child and understanding how they might choose to bypass parental controls. when it comes to preventing the misuse of education apps as distractions, parents should allocate time to check with their children on their progress to ascertain if the time invested in these learning apps is producing the intended results, said mr tantri. ms loi the digital family educator, however points out that the most effective parental control software is heartware. invest time and energy to build a strong bond... the best tools are the internal filtering and monitoring tools that our children build for themselves, to discern what is right and wrong, healthy or not healthy, on their own, she said.",1

parenting experts said that ideally mobile phones and tablets should not be introduced to children unless absolutely necessary. think many times before giving your children a gadget. if its not a school requirement, better delay it until the kids have a strong digital literacy, said mr jumh tantri, parenting coach from hesed psychotherapy international. acknowledging that for most parents that ship has sailed, experts advised incremental usage and finally ownership of such devices. dr jiow hee jhee, who is an associate professor at the singapore institute of technology researching the impact of digital media on families, said there needs to be a distinction between ownership and usage. let the children use the device purposefully for a few hours, then return the device parents. so start with usage, slowly build up and allow longer usage times, and train them to be responsible, said dr jiow, whose children started out using his spare mobile phones only when they needed to inform him when they were done with their co-curricular activities. if such devices are already a part of children's lives, parenting experts pointed out that screen time is not necessarily a bad thing if consumed in moderation and with a purpose. mr tantri considers two hours or less of screen time a healthy amount as long as a break is taken every 20 to 30 minutes. more than three hours, he pointed out, can lead to myopia, obesity and social isolation, among other issues. overall, parents need to ensure that their children are not neglecting their sleep time, oral hygiene, meal times, or intentionally holding in their urine just to use their devices. in addition to instilling time limitations, it is also advisable to demarcate tech-free areas in the home to help maintain a balance of screen-based and non-screen-based activities around the house, said mr tantri. another suggestion is to use separate devices for learning and entertainment. this way, there is a clear distinction between the devices which minimises distraction. parents should monitor learning devices to ensure that social media apps, games and other forms of entertainment are not installed there, added mr tantri. parenting experts said that nothing beats setting a positive example for children to model after, which means adults need to abide by these tech-free zones as well. ms ksther lim, 46, for example, made it a rule that mobile phones are not allowed at the dining table during meal times. setting a positive example also means showing children how they themselves have a healthy balance between online and offline worlds, said experts. this means showing them that entertainment does not have to come from a device after their childs screen time is up, parents should consider bringing them to public libraries, museums, and playgrounds or letting them do household chores. these make for great group activities that engage the different senses and activate different parts of the brain for great mental and physiological health, said mr tantri. parenting experts stressed the importance of open communication with their children from a young age about the use of such devices. among the questions parents can ask themselves are why are they overindulging in screen time? are they missing human connections and are hence seeking companionship by gaming and chatting with online friends? using this knowledge, mr tantri suggested that parents and children can then intentionally come up with rules together in terms of how they would like to balance online and offline time. to prevent future disputes, parents also need to be transparent in discussing the types of content that are allowed and actively engage in a dialogue about their childrens media consumption. digital wellness educator and family coach carol loi said discuss openly who your children are following on social media why are your children following these influencers and what they are learning from them. listen actively and be open to hearing their perspectives. building a culture of openness and transparency will reduce disagreements in the family because there will be a focus on how to journey life together. she added that when disagreements happen, they can focus on the values that the family holds dear. for example, they can talk about why or why not does a particular influencer create a positive impact on society. ms lim, who is a mother of a 15-year-old, said she has managed to cultivate this level of trust with her son who shows her his social media feed so that they can discuss what is trending and what he enjoys watching online. while she sometimes disagrees with the content that he is consuming, her son is receptive to a discussion on the issue. for instance, she wanted him to stop following a gaming youtuber's channel because the influencer used a significant amount of profanity in his speech. but her son reassured her that he would not start swearing like the youtuber. she kept a watchful eye on his language and since he kept his promise, she did not insist that he stop following that influencer. mr tantri emphasised that parents have to make their children see that any dialogue comes from a good place and that they do not want the kids to be disadvantaged by the consequences of irresponsible screen use. parents should also adapt rules at home as their children grow up. for example, 12-year-olds usually require close monitoring and sensitive communication in explaining strict rules, while 16-year-olds need less of that because they should understand the need for such rules and the consequences. beyond conversations and setting boundaries, parents can also turn to a few common applications to monitor their childrens screen activities including microsoft family safety and google family link. these applications allow parents to set screen time limits and filter any inappropriate content that may be harmful to children of a certain age group. parental control software however is not foolproof. teens may figure out ways to bypass parental control software by looking for loopholes on online discussion forums and those familiar with hacking through their experience in gaming and coding are also likely to know how to handle technical situations such as de-configuring the system, said mr tantri. tech blog editor alfred siew added that parents would do well to change up their passwords once in a while. he said that his children figured out the passwords of other adult family members mobile phones because the adults typed the passwords in front of the children. they did this many times. this is problematic because they are logged in as an adult and theres no parental controls, he said. dr jiow, who is a member of the media literacy council, added that one of his studies found that a child installed a video camera at a strategic location in the house and was able to see the parent typing in the password. it is not always easy to stay ahead of these techniques but mr tantri suggested that parents can start by thinking from the perspective of a child and understanding how they might choose to bypass parental controls. when it comes to preventing the misuse of education apps as distractions, parents should allocate time to check with their children on their progress to ascertain if the time invested in these learning apps is producing the intended results, said mr tantri. ms loi the digital family educator, however points out that the most effective parental control software is heartware. invest time and energy to build a strong bond... the best tools are the internal filtering and monitoring tools that our children build for themselves, to discern what is right and wrong, healthy or not healthy, on their own, she said.",1

are they missing human connections and are hence seeking companionship by gaming and chatting with online friends? using this knowledge, mr tantri suggested that parents and children can then intentionally come up with rules together in terms of how they would like to balance online and offline time. to prevent future disputes, parents also need to be transparent in discussing the types of content that are allowed and actively engage in a dialogue about their childrens media consumption. digital wellness educator and family coach carol loi said discuss openly who your children are following on social media why are your children following these influencers and what they are learning from them. listen actively and be open to hearing their perspectives. building a culture of openness and transparency will reduce disagreements in the family because there will be a focus on how to journey life together. she added that when disagreements happen, they can focus on the values that the family holds dear. for example, they can talk about why or why not does a particular influencer create a positive impact on society. ms lim, who is a mother of a 15-year-old, said she has managed to cultivate this level of trust with her son who shows her his social media feed so that they can discuss what is trending and what he enjoys watching online. while she sometimes disagrees with the content that he is consuming, her son is receptive to a discussion on the issue. for instance, she wanted him to stop following a gaming youtuber's channel because the influencer used a significant amount of profanity in his speech. but her son reassured her that he would not start swearing like the youtuber. she kept a watchful eye on his language and since he kept his promise, she did not insist that he stop following that influencer. mr tantri emphasised that parents have to make their children see that any dialogue comes from a good place and that they do not want the kids to be disadvantaged by the consequences of irresponsible screen use. parents should also adapt rules at home as their children grow up. for example, 12-year-olds usually require close monitoring and sensitive communication in explaining strict rules, while 16-year-olds need less of that because they should understand the need for such rules and the consequences. beyond conversations and setting boundaries, parents can also turn to a few common applications to monitor their childrens screen activities including microsoft family safety and google family link. these applications allow parents to set screen time limits and filter any inappropriate content that may be harmful to children of a certain age group. parental control software however is not foolproof. teens may figure out ways to bypass parental control software by looking for loopholes on online discussion forums and those familiar with hacking through their experience in gaming and coding are also likely to know how to handle technical situations such as de-configuring the system, said mr tantri. tech blog editor alfred siew added that parents would do well to change up their passwords once in a while. he said that his children figured out the passwords of other adult family members mobile phones because the adults typed the passwords in front of the children. they did this many times. this is problematic because they are logged in as an adult and theres no parental controls, he said. dr jiow, who is a member of the media literacy council, added that one of his studies found that a child installed a video camera at a strategic location in the house and was able to see the parent typing in the password. it is not always easy to stay ahead of these techniques but mr tantri suggested that parents can start by thinking from the perspective of a child and understanding how they might choose to bypass parental controls. when it comes to preventing the misuse of education apps as distractions, parents should allocate time to check with their children on their progress to ascertain if the time invested in these learning apps is producing the intended results, said mr tantri. ms loi the digital family educator, however points out that the most effective parental control software is heartware. invest time and energy to build a strong bond... the best tools are the internal filtering and monitoring tools that our children build for themselves, to discern what is right and wrong, healthy or not healthy, on their own, she said.",1

(from a market pricing perspective), the resale market in this area probably reaches near a million dollars (for a similar flat). steven so if you leave it to pure market forces - demand and supply - prices would be out of reach for certain groups? tien foo yes, you would squeeze out some segments even though they prefer to stay in this location. steven so even with the clawback, even though there are certain restrictions, it seems like a pretty good deal for someone in that situation. tien foo that's right. for this location, (with the subsidies), they can still afford it. nicholas mak it's a good entry-level public housing (unit), and i think that is something that's unique to singapore. i think very few countries, their governments are able to provide very affordable public housing, especially for young families, as the first step on the property ladder. and singapore is able to do it because one of the reasons is that the government is the biggest owner of land.",1
rules,CNA,Community Behavior,Social Interactions,31/10/2024 8:13,1.2494041,103.8303209,HarbourFront,"without a doubt, visiting a spa for a much-needed massage or pampering facial is the most relaxing thing to do, especially when the going gets tough. a haven to unwind, it is a place where time slows down and stress melts away. when visiting this oasis of tranquility, understanding and practicing proper spa etiquette can enhance the relaxing and peaceful atmosphere, not only for you, but for everyone else around too. whether youre a seasoned spa-goer or first-time visitor, here are 10 spa etiquette rules to follow basic spa etiquette often calls for good hygiene practice, and that includes taking a shower before a massage. this helps cleanse and prepare the skin for the treatment, said sheryl wan, director, the st regis spa singapore. in the same line, men are also advised to shave prior to a facial as well, shared sabrina chen, spa director, oasia spa, oasia resort sentosa. a shaved skin also prevents any accidental pulling of the facial hair during the treatment, added wan. and of course, do reschedule your appointment if youre unwell. spas provide robes and disposable slippers, which you can wear for maximum comfort. some spas will also advise you to not wear your shoes, unless stated otherwise, within the spa facilities to preserve the cleanliness of the space. if youre planning to use the wet facilities plunge pools, steam room or sauna, bring along your swimwear to protect your modesty. and keep your valuable jewellery at home to avoid misplacing them as you change in and out of your clothes. we know youre busy, but when youre checked in for your spa appointment, where the focus is on relaxation and destressing, you should turn your mobile phone off. after all, one of the primary reasons why you visit a spa in the first place is to disconnect from whatever is stressing you. turning your phone off completely helps reinforce that sense of escape and relaxation, fully immersing yourself in the spa experience, allowing for a deeper sense of relaxation without the temptation to check messages or calls, chen added. and no, keeping it on silent mode with vibration doesnt count. the buzzing sound can be distracting to guests who are there to unwind in the peaceful spa environment, [especially if your phone is kept in the locker] which are also communal spaces, said chen. the last thing youd want is to have a growling tummy while getting a massage or facial. so its ideal not to go hungry, especially if your treatment happens near or around meal-times. its generally advisable to eat a light meal or snack about one to two hours before your appointment to allow your body to digest the food partially, while minimising any discomfort during the treatment itself, said chen. not sure what to have? opt for light, easily digestible snacks, such as fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, yoghurt smoothies or whole grain crackers, said wan. yes, it happens. and if you do feel the urge to use the restroom in the middle of your treatment, simply inform your therapist and they will be more than happy to pause the treatment for you. ladies, hands up if you tend to keep your bra on during your facials. and while both chen and wan shared that it is personal preference, removing your bra would be generally more comfortable. facials often involve lying down for an extended period, and removing the bra allows for more relaxation, especially around the shoulders and back, where the straps might dig in, said chen. in addition, many facials include massages of the neck, shoulders and even decolletage, so removing your bra allows the therapist easier access to these areas without obstructions from straps or hooks, shared wan. moreover, facials often involve the use of oils, and removing your bra can prevent these products from staining the fabric, added chen. whoever said you cant enjoy a massage even when you are on your period? according to wan, some women find having a massage helpful in menstrual cramps. to enjoy your massage fully, it is important to inform the therapist of the situation. this can help her adjust the massage pressure and focus on areas that can provide relief, such as the lower back, added wan. at the same time, chen advised ensuring that you use appropriate menstrual products, such tampons or menstrual cups, and are prepared to manage any potential leaks or discomfort during the session. however, intensive treatments, such as deep tissue or abdominal massages, as well as treatments involving water like scrubs and body wraps, should be postponed. as much as it would be a real treat to go for a massage after a boozy brunch, you really shouldnt. in fact, it is advisable to refrain from drinking alcohol before or after treatments, and when using the heat and water facilities, to ensure sufficient hydration and wellbeing, said wan. alcohol is a diuretic, which means it promotes dehydration and might even increase the risk of muscle cramps during your massage. in addition, massages and the use of sauna, steam room and plunge pools typically promote circulation. thus, with alcohol in your system, the enhanced blood flow can result in a quicker intoxication and potentially, a severe hangover. its no secret that many of us long for a spa day. but how long can you really stay at the spa to use the facilities without feeling like you have outstayed your welcome? whilst there is no strict time limit, staying in the spa facilities for a full day could be a little too much for some as prolonged use [of the steam room, sauna, plunge pools] may result in dehydration or fatigue that can lead to low blood pressure, dizziness or even fainting, said wan. it is also wise to check with the spa about any specific policies beforehand. this is because some spas may also have policies, such as time limits or reservations, especially during peak times, to ensure that all guests have a chance to use the facilities, said chen. although tipping in a spa is not a common practice, it is an appreciated gesture and reflects your level of satisfaction with the service. tips usually range from 10 to 15 per cent, and you can either give it directly therapist after the treatment or leave it at the spa reception in an envelope for the therapist, shared wan. alternatively, you can also add the tip bill as well.",1

and made the mistake of confiding this group. they promptly shunned her, spread word of her mental health struggles and shamed her for also harming herself. when confronted, they told her she was too different for their liking. at that time, it felt really cruel, said leah, now 22. i was upset and i did feel betrayed. pushed brink, she decided to drop out and enrol in a private institution to take her o-levels. but the girls weren't done, with one of them threatening to tell leah's parents about her mental health issues unless she slept with the girls ex-boyfriend. while perhaps less visible, leah's case was no less insidious than a spate of physical and visceral bullying instances that have surfaced in recent weeks. in september, a video of a bukit view secondary school pupil being taunted and kicked ground made online rounds, prompting police investigations. a week later, an online clip of a qihua primary school student being assaulted by an older boy led arrest of five teenagers. and earlier in october, a meridian secondary school pupil reportedly ruptured her right eardrum after being attacked by schoolmates. according ministry of education (moe) the average number of bullying incidents has remained steady in the last five years. for every 1,000 students, there were an average of two incidents in primary schools and six incidents in secondary schools annually, for any form of bullying and both inside and outside school. yet questions have since been raised, including by lawmakers, on whether schools and teachers are sufficiently equipped today to deal with bullying. if the answer is no, is it time then for other authorities such as the courts and the police to play a bigger role? and how do parents fit inprocess? while there may be policies and interventions in schools, bullying these days extends beyond the school to include the virtual environment, chairperson of the government parliamentary committee (gpc) for education patrick tay told cna. there are more situations where educators are unable to handle bullying and may even put themselves at risk to threats and harms, said mr tay, whos member of parliament for pioneer. it is therefore imperative that educators are not just equipped to handle such scenarios, but that law enforcement and other community services agencies beef up their capabilities to work with schools and the community, to combat egregious bullying behaviours and the bullies themselves who may be facing issues beyond the school environment. the parents and victims in this article asked to either be anonymous or use aliases as they didn't want to be identified through the specifics of their cases. the names of the teachers and school staff members have also been changed as they're not authorised to speak media. the issue of bullying, in light of the recent high-profile incidents, was discussed in parliament earlier this month. in response to a series of questions by mps, education minister chan chun sing highlighted how teachers are trained to proactively deal with bullying as well as recognising students in distress. all pre-service teachers receive this training, and new teachers are supported by experienced staff and school counsellors. in-service teachers also receive refresher training as part of their professional development, he said. nonetheless, on platforms like reddit, some parents of bullied children can be found airing frustrations over a perceived lack of action from schools and teachers. some even claimed to have signed their kids up for self-defence lessons to ward off bullies. cna spoke to some parents who felt their child's teacher could have done more, either to deal with known cases of bullying or creating an environment where students feel they can report what is happening to them. in the case of primary school student benjamin (not his real name), he didn't want teachers, particularly his form teacher, to know he was being bullied. that's because he feared being put in the spotlight - but also because he didn't think they'd handle it well, according to his mother. benjamin was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease at four years old. it requires him to be on steroids, which made him put on weight and led to peers laughing at him and calling him fat and ugly. in primary 4, he became the target of slurs and vulgarities in a whatsapp group chat with classmates. his mother stepped in, leaving a voice message in the chat to ask why they were doing this to her son. it didn't change anything. when visible scars appeared on his body as a result of his illness, benjamin was told he was weird-looking and the word disgusting was thrown around. his mother described his form teacher as not someone willing to listen to what a child has to say, which was a barrier to him reporting the bullies. when you always cut a child off, he will probably not want to come to you with his problems, she said. in response to a question in parliament about whether there will be more channels for reporting of bullying, minister chan said we want to give people and students the confidence that if you are in doubt, where you feel troubled, you should be able to use the existing channels to report it adults and then have the adults work with the students to see how they can mend the relationships and move the relationships forward. when leah dropped out of the school, she didn't tell anyone it was due to bullying. her form teacher just stood on the sidelines and never asked about her reasons for leaving, she said. leah's mother told cna that a conversation with the teacher revealed she was aware of the bullying but thought the students would sort it out themselves. she, too, said that teachers cannot be expected to do it all. but in this case, if it's happening in front of your eyes, you need to not just stand there and observe. you need to do something. schools have rules to prohibit any form of bullying, minister chan said during the parliamentary sitting earlier this month. most cases within school grounds are dealt with by teachers, while more serious ones go to counsellors. while training to deal with bullying is provided, some teachers told cna it leans towards the theoretical - for example, listing actions that teachers can take in certain situations. in real life, however, there are myriad issues to consider such as the environment a child grows up in and the influence of peers and parents. in addition, the training can only go so far and teachers need to go beyond what the sessions cover. the course that we were put through is pretty much at the surface level, said madam han, who has taught in primary schools for 13 years. it requires an educator to really take interest and read up more to equip (themselves) even better. it also boils down to being more alert and sensitive to class dynamics and forming the sort of relationships with students that make them comfortable enough to open up and seek guidance if bullied. cultivating such rapport with students, again, depends on individual teachers, said mdm han. some educators may question why theyre wasting time on such things instead of focusing on completing the syllabus and, well, teaching. if this is the belief of the teacher, then naturally, the teacher would not want to spend her energy, effort, her time on issues that concern bullying, she said. my personal belief is that we need to spend time on this in order to save time later. then there are teachers who remain very deep-rooted in so-called traditional beliefs, said mdm han. (they may think) for things like that, you just have to suck it up. you just have to 'man' up. you just have to be resilient. the founder of the non-profit coalition against bullying for children & youth (cabcy) esther ng said schools have been more evident in efforts to advocate against bullying over the years. yet bullying can still recur in subtler forms - such as being ostracised - and overwhelm victims, said the psychotherapist by profession. when a bullying incident escalates, the standard operating procedure or sop in some schools entails informing discipline teachers and parents of the students involved. investigations will be conducted and if the school finds evidence of bullying, a decision will be made on next steps. these can include counselling and using conflict resolution tools such as restorative practice to try and repair the harm done. caning, as a form of corporal punishment in schools, is also allowed by law. but it cannot be administered to girls, and is usually done as a last resort and carried out by authorised adults only. secondary school counsellor lucas highlighted that caning the perpetrators may not necessarily stop them from misbehaving. they will just say that this is already the harshest punishment, so the school cannot put anything on me anymore. these students are already very bold so sometimes they are not even afraid of caning, he added. at the same time, using corporal punishment can lead to teachers having to answer to unhappy parents - who may then blow up the matter on social media or even threaten legal action, said secondary school teacher peter. parents will challenge the punishments, the consequences that we have decided for their children. sometimes they make it quite difficult for us to carry them out. they might be unaware that in doing such things, they are teaching their own children to disregard authority, he added. (that) even though there's a punishment given, if you are able to kick up a big fuss and be able to resist that, you might actually get away with things. parental support was highlighted by minister chan in parliament, who said that efforts are made to help students learn from their mistakes, rather than simply expelling them or suspending them from school. when relationships are affected due to conflicts or misconduct, schools and institutions take steps to educate, discipline and restore relationships in the school community, and these efforts require parents' support and partnership, he said. david was bullied before he became a bully. when in primary 5, his classmates called him fat in mandarin, and he was initially clueless since he wasn't chinese. the experience subconsciously put an idea in his head that oh, this is how to bully people, said david, who only wanted to be known by his first name. for bullying incidents that take place in public areas - such as in the bukit view secondary and qihua primary cases - the schools need to intervene if the students involved are in their uniforms, teachers told cna. for example, if a victim wants to make a police report, the school will share the necessary information with authorities. but for violent situations in particular, the school might seek help from the police in the first instance, said secondary school counsellor emily. we are not law enforcers. we can go out to observe, but we cannot go there to stop the other people who are not our students. when there's a fight going on we don't know how helpful we will be. so most of the time, we call the police to settle. parents cna spoke to highlighted the importance of having laws that kick in and impose penalties should schools be unable to manage bullying cases, especially serious ones. in singapore, the protection from harassment act (poha) provides criminal and civil remedies against harassment. victims of school bullying can be protected under the act, which states that intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress to another person is an offence, lawyers said. there's also no stipulation that the victim has to be of a minimum age. two lawyers cna spoke to said they haven't come across school bullying cases often. but ms gloria james-civetta's eponymous legal firm has received enquiries on what to do in bullying situations. lawyers there have also been approached by parents wishing to obtain a protection order against another student. our initial advice is typically first to alert the bullys parents and the school, to try and get the matter settled there before escalating the matter police or to court, perhaps through teachers or counsellors, said ms james-civetta. this is because while the matter may be resolved, the children will continue seeing each other in school. there is a danger that the bullying persists and perhaps escalates, she added. in such a situation, a cease and desist letter can be sent bullys parents to alert them and demand that the perpetrator stops. ms bestlyn loo, a counsel at providence law asia, cautioned that when the law gets involved in school bullying, minors end up being introduced harsh criminal justice system. it may be more helpful to have anti-bullying legislation that requires all schools to have a standardised set of policies, procedures and penalties for violence, she said. other lawyers also said it may be worthwhile to have laws specifically targeting bullies in school. on the police's part, investigations into bullying cases begin if there is a prima facie - at first impression - arrestable offence and there are sufficient grounds to proceed. the singapore police force told cna it adopts a victim-centric approach in the process. for egregious cases, police investigations will include interviews, recording statements, gathering evidence and referring the case attorney-general's chambers for prosecutorial action as appropriate. the police said it will also work with moe to manage the involved parties appropriately. mr chan, the education minister, noted in his parliament speech this month that adults sometimes can also be a complicating factor in bullying cases. sometimes these are most unhelpful in helping us to manage a situation on hand and rehabilitate the perpetrator and help the victim to heal. echoing what other teachers told cna, chloe, a primary school educator of 22 years, said parents are more outspoken these days - and school management more inclined to listen to and abide by the wishes of parents. additionally and possibly relatedly, levels of discipline in schools are no longer as strong, putting at risk the structures needed to spell out the consequences of students' actions, she added. if schools really step up with the discipline, then maybe things could be better. we don't have to wait until something happens and goes out innews, to say we do not condone, said chloe. if there's a very fixed system (where) we're not scared of parents, we are very firm in what we do, then ... students will understand the boundaries and they will try not to push it too much. parents meanwhile need to be better role models and not behave in ways that are unwittingly forms of bullying for kids to pick up on, said lucas the counsellor. for example, if too stressed out from work, parents may use anger or aggression on their child. that shuts the child up very quickly ... so at home, the child can be very well-behaved, because (he or she) is very afraid of their parents, he said. but in school, that oppression is being released. so they become their parents' shadow. i would say that bullying sometimes starts from parents. while leah's mother countered that parents also need to teach their children to stand up for themselves, she agreed bullies are made and not born and that upbringing and family environment matter. she also pointed to singapore's children and young persons act, which among other things makes it an offence for parents to influence a child to develop anti-social behaviour. this could more explicitly include bullying, she suggested. the mum reiterated the need for teachers to actively monitor known bullies and immediately report incidents. parents and teachers need to work together to create an action plan, she said. many parties cna spoke to for this story concurred. in the experience of emily, the other counsellor, collaborating closely with parents has been constructive and the more open ones have even ended up going for family therapy sessions to help their children. when parents allow themselves to be vulnerable and work together with the different stakeholders, it is more effective than (a) power struggle to blame who is not doing their job, she added. the goal, said ms ng from the cabcy anti-bullying coalition, must be to raise a generation to appreciate the right to be in a classroom that embraces equity - and fundamentally, to go to school safely.",1

and school management more inclined to listen to and abide by the wishes of parents. additionally and possibly relatedly, levels of discipline in schools are no longer as strong, putting at risk the structures needed to spell out the consequences of students' actions, she added. if schools really step up with the discipline, then maybe things could be better. we don't have to wait until something happens and goes out innews, to say we do not condone, said chloe. if there's a very fixed system (where) we're not scared of parents, we are very firm in what we do, then ... students will understand the boundaries and they will try not to push it too much. parents meanwhile need to be better role models and not behave in ways that are unwittingly forms of bullying for kids to pick up on, said lucas the counsellor. for example, if too stressed out from work, parents may use anger or aggression on their child. that shuts the child up very quickly ... so at home, the child can be very well-behaved, because (he or she) is very afraid of their parents, he said. but in school, that oppression is being released. so they become their parents' shadow. i would say that bullying sometimes starts from parents. while leah's mother countered that parents also need to teach their children to stand up for themselves, she agreed bullies are made and not born and that upbringing and family environment matter. she also pointed to singapore's children and young persons act, which among other things makes it an offence for parents to influence a child to develop anti-social behaviour. this could more explicitly include bullying, she suggested. the mum reiterated the need for teachers to actively monitor known bullies and immediately report incidents. parents and teachers need to work together to create an action plan, she said. many parties cna spoke to for this story concurred. in the experience of emily, the other counsellor, collaborating closely with parents has been constructive and the more open ones have even ended up going for family therapy sessions to help their children. when parents allow themselves to be vulnerable and work together with the different stakeholders, it is more effective than (a) power struggle to blame who is not doing their job, she added. the goal, said ms ng from the cabcy anti-bullying coalition, must be to raise a generation to appreciate the right to be in a classroom that embraces equity - and fundamentally, to go to school safely.",1

or are there changes in workplace culture and attitudes that could be more fruitful? never waste a good crisis as the saying goes. singapore has the opportunity to undertake a root and branch review of telemedicine in the context of how it is today and how it should be tomorrow. singapore does not have geographic access issues the way that much larger countries with dispersed populations may have, and telemedicines use case in expanding access may be more tightly circumscribed. on the other hand, we have reliable, high-speed internet access and with advancements in video analytics and artificial intelligence, perhaps coupled with smartphone-enabled diagnostics, telemedicine platforms may soon be able to assess vital signs and conduct even physical examinations virtually. it would be a pity to dismiss or downplay telemedicine now, when we have an opportunity to promote it in settings of greatest value. dr jeremy lim is a medical doctor and public health specialist. he is author of myth or magic - the singapore healthcare system. koh lin pin is an incoming medical student at the yong loo lin school of medicine, national university of singapore.",1

institute (ici) at pok fu lam, a heritage site that was a former dairy farm over a century ago. on monday (oct 28), 10 talented chefs under 30 from maldives, hong kong, thailand, singapore, indonesia, japan and south korea were given five hours to cook and 15 minutes to present their dishes jury of seven acclaimed chefs in the region. the winners were announced the same evening at the murray hotel with all the chef contestants mingling over new friendships and comradery formed in the last 48 hours. indonesian-canadian chef ardy ferguson, 29, from hong kongs belon restaurant clinched the winning spot, beating nine other young chefs and impressed the jury with his nasi tumpeng dish a celebratory traditional javanese cone-shaped rice dish served with vegetables and meat, in this case grilled hong kong duck. in its sixth edition of the s.pellegrino young chef academy awards, several singapore chefs had previously won since its inception and went on to represent the region in milan. this year, singapore was represented by law jia-jun of province and labyrinth junior sous chef william yee, who won one of the three collateral prizes the acqua panna connection in gastronomy award for his pigeon dish inspired by his childhood flavours of malaysian street food. the global initiative aims to discover and mentor the most talented young chefs under 30 worldwide. the jury is guided by the three golden rules strong technical skills, creativity and a compelling narrative on food and identity. the highest score is then awarded winner. in preparation of the grand finals in milan in 2025, ferguson will be mentored by former global jury hong kong chef vicky lau. a nod to his indonesian roots, the electrical engineering student had a later start in his culinary career. i grew up in jakarta and my mother cooked every single day and i didnt appreciate it until i moved away from home for university in canada. nasi tumpeng is a celebratory dish for large family gatherings, and this competition for me is a celebration of young talent and all the chefs coming together. the poultry here in hong kong is unlike any other and i wanted to respect and represent the culture where i have been living for the past three years, while still making a tribute culture i grew up in. under the guidance of his chef mentor, mathew kirkley, ferguson reckoned his winning edge was serving hot food. he used a metal bowl and kept it in the steamer at 85 degrees celsius, removing the bowl just before the dish was served. the judges were duly impressed that the rice was still piping hot at the presentation. my sauce was a sate padang base. i roasted the duck bones, but i also used cinnamon, chillis, nutmeg, coriander, and fresh coconut milk indonesia is a spice island. i wanted to pack it all in. i used all the pulp to make the sauce which gave it an intense underlying tone of coconut. roast meats are a hallmark of hong kongs culinary scene and ferguson adapted the technique to cook his duck first scalding it, then lacquering it in red wine vinegar to give it a beautiful colour before smoking the fowl with sugar cane the result is a delicious sweet and smoky roast paired with the rich blend of southeast asian spices and flavours over piping hot rice. kevin wong of seroja, a former global finalist at the s.pellegrino young chef awards and guest chef at the event shared the scene has really evolved since i participated as a young chef. weve grown as a community and many chefs have given their insights and feedback to our singaporean candidates. less is more to create impact, when theres too much going on, you lose focus on the main purpose of the dish. food has to be eaten, the tastebud has to be wowed before it pleases the eye. hong kong chef vicky cheng on the jury echoed wong creativity is important, identity is important but without deliciousness, none of this matters. thats what im looking for in a plate. it has to taste good. asia has a diverse culinary representation with complex rich flavours. historically the region is rich in agriculture, and the climate's bounty of tropical produce is unique in this part of the world, whilst also being surrounded by the ocean where seafood dishes feature often on menus. the regions culinary history and heritage (through wars and colonialism) spans centuries lying on important trade routes, where spices and different ingredients were traded and introduced into local cuisines. meanwhile, chef lg han, a mentor to yee, was thrilled to see the new generation of young chefs evolving through these experiences, at the end of the day, these competitions are for our chefs' personal growth how to be better, to gain confidence and practice, learn about their shortcomings. they are making new connections, expanding their network, and making friends around asia. i'm so happy to see that. i am really proud of william, hes worked so hard, and hes done so well. the five hours pass quickly as you have to do everything from scratch. jury chef tam of baan tepa culinary space in bangkok added time management is an important aspect in this competition. things can go wrong during this competition, and you really must focus on the things that matter. juries johanne siy of lolla in singapore and vicky lau of tate dining room in hong kong were also pleased to see more women representation in the culinary profession in this new generation. media and cooking shows have helped to a huge extent and having other women role models. women are great at adapting to situations, pivoting, multi-tasking, which are all important skills in running a professional kitchen, shares siy, who runs lolla. another collateral prize, the s.pellegrino social responsibility award, was

can watch election rallies live from the key battleground states our social media feeds are filled with viral videos as both campaigns court online voters everyone has an opinion of whether kamala harris or donald trump will prevail. with just days to go before nov 5, the us election has become a topic of lunchtime conversations, not just academic conferences. i know people who would be hard-pressed to name all the electoral constituencies in singapore, but they can rattle off the names of the seven us swing states with ease. as us election season reaches its climax, however, it is timely for singaporeans to step back and ask an important question what does the us election mean for our country? answering this requires an appreciation of the development of us-singapore ties and how the election affects the very order under which singapore thrives. the us-singapore relationship is not rooted in a recognition of shared values as idyllic as that may sound. it has been and will continue to be about shared interests, especially when it comes stability of the rules-based order. for singapore, the bilateral relationship hinges on the recognition that only the us has the capacity to guarantee the regional order in asia. in the post-cold war era, there were fears that a us withdrawal would cause a chain reaction of destabilisation in asia. it was for this reason that singapore offered the us the use of its air and naval bases in 1990, intent on keeping the us invested in the region after it was forced to leave subic bay. washington and singapore do not always see eye to eye but the strategic logic that underpins their relationship is not affected by us election outcomes. rather, singapore adapts realities of the situation as they arise, adjusting their approach as political currents in washington change. at present, these political currents point to a bipartisan suspicion towards china and free trade. competition with china will be the guiding force of us asia policy for either a harris or trump administration. neither is also unlikely to pursue multilateral trade deals due to growing domestic unhappiness against free trade, while being more suspicious of alleged chinese efforts to circumvent us tariffs. since both candidates would likely follow the same strategic trajectory on asia, the difference comes from their approach over the next four years. should she win, vice president kamala harris would likely continue the pragmatic, multilateral approach that her predecessor, president joe biden, pursued during his term. this would include support for climate change agreements and a more consultative approach to allies, both of which singapore would prefer. she is also likely to continue the biden-era china policy of being competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be. while entailing some risk over miscalculations, such a policy would at least present continuity instead of drastic change. in southeast asia, however, harris may face larger challenges in renewing the us value proposition region. she would be more likely to attend high-level asean events than trump (who skipped most of them, even those held virtually). but it would be hard to convince regional governments of us commitment region without a multilateral trade deal. her likely focus on human rights may also complicate efforts to reach out to regional governments by appearing irrelevant or condescending. singapore, which hopes for the us to support the regional security architecture, would likely be worried by such developments, especially if it comes under pressure to do more for washington. trump, on the other hand, would present much more risk vis-a-vis his china policy. his tariff threats would wreak havoc on global trade and supply chains if carried out. he may also go even further, considering one of his former cabinet members called for a complete decoupling from china. the trading system would eventually recover, but not before suffering prolonged turbulence. despite this, a second trump administration may counterintuitively make inroads with southeast asian governments. his transactional approach may find more support in southeast asia, where governments prefer to talk about deliverables such as investment deals instead of human rights and values. he may also find common ground and personal rapport with regional leaders such as indonesian president prabowo subianto, given his affinity with strongmen who can get things done regardless of conventional restraints. singapore leaders might have to change tack, planning more one-on-one discussions between heads of government to secure commitments from the us. neither scenario is risk-free. far from being a cliche, singapore should prepare for a bumpy road ahead, regardless of who wins. harris may provide the multilateral leadership that singapore wants on issues such as climate change but fail to resuscitate us policy on southeast asia. trump might make inroads with southeast asian leaders but cause chaos with his trade and china policies. while building on the same strategic understandings, the exact shape of these policies will depend on the advisers the victorious candidate employs. for the average singaporean halfway around the world, it is important to understand that singapores relations with other states do not hinge on the identity of a single leader. we are price-takers instead of price-setters, and any moral misgivings we have need to take a backseat in the pursuit of our national interests. however, this does not mean we are helpless, as we retain the agency to stand our ground against foreign pressure. the other takeaway is that the us stands as a cautionary tale of how a country can become politically divided. polarisation begets polarisation, with more sociocultural fault lines to exploit. regardless of the outcome of the november election, it will take a long process of conversation and healing before the polarised nature of us politics can ebb, if ever. as singaporeans, we should value the harmonious society we live in and strive to keep it that way. kevin chen is

rules,CNA,Technology,Blockchain,27/10/2024 7:44,1.2966426,103.7763939,Kent Ridge,"on weekday evenings after wrapping up my work day, i often head straight to my pizzeria where i pull a night shift laying out dough and toppings for hungry customers. that is, my virtual pizzeria, serving a range of unique toppings spanning eggplant to artichokes all from my living room. while free of the heat from a real oven and many other challenges of working at a food-and-beverage business, i have my work cut out for me. take it from someone on day 260 (in game time) of managing impatient customers, watching their satisfaction meters drop, dodging bad reviews and competing with recipe-stealing rivals. instead of unwinding with a movie or book after work, lately i find myself diving into games that simulate work tasks across a variety of occupations. and im not alone in my moonlighting. many of my peers similarly take on second shifts after work, spending hours stocking shelves in their virtual supermarkets or driving a truck across europe. perhaps surprisingly, instead of video games that plunge players into fantasy or futuristic worlds, a sub-genre that simulates the nitty-gritty of everyday occupations, such as cleaning offices or managing staff, has gained popularity. for example, a paid trading card game shop simulator that was released on online game platform steam on sept 15 this year already boasts overwhelmingly positive reviews from close to 17,000 users. the irony is not lost on me why do we after long, often stressful workdays choose to unwind by playing games that simulate even more work? reverting to my day job, i spoke with psychologists and gaming experts to explore why work simulation games might be so appealing during stressful times and whether there are any red flags to watch out for when taking on these virtual second shifts. some experts suggested that work simulation games could be useful stress relief as they offer a sense of control and freedom without requiring significant time investment or prior video game experience. also, while these games are premised on simulating real-life occupations, many of them strip away the more unpleasant elements and stakes of actual work. in high-pressure work environments like those in singapore, dr karen pooh, a clinical psychologist at alliance counselling, said such games are a mental refuge for players to escape real-world pressures while still feeling productive. in our unpredictable, fast-paced world, real-life jobs often come with factors beyond our control, like office politics or unexpected challenges, which can feel overwhelming. in contrast, simulators provide a contained environment where we call the shots, dictating the pace, decisions and outcomes, said dr pooh. simulation games provide structured tasks, clear goals and immediate gratification, offering a sense of accomplishment that demanding work environments may lack, she added. dr jeremy sng, a lecturer from nanyang technological university who studies the psychological and behavioral outcomes of media use, said that in contrast to ambiguous feedback at work, work simulation games could be more rewarding as they offer clear pathways to success. a lot of (such games) have clear and distilled game mechanics, very clear rules about what you should do and what will happen. and its very low stakes, so if you fail the stage, you can just do it again, said dr sng. as compared to fantasy or war games, dr sng said work-based games may scratch that itch for management and organisation, lending a sense of competence that fantasy-based games may not offer. they also provide the chance to experiment with real world occupations in a fun yet safe manner, allowing players to be rewarded for their hand-eye coordination or reaction time. while such games that simulate real-life tasks are not new, as seen in popular cooking simulator video game series cooking mama, dr sng said a greater variety of more specific trades may be popping up now to fill a niche in the gaming market. although work simulation games offer a simplified version of real-life jobs, these games are often designed to mimic real-life challenges and mundanities. one friend, for example, recounted the mathematical woes of taking an in-game loan to help fund a x-ray machine for the virtual hospital he manages on his laptop. at first glance, it seems odd to actively choose games that mirror the stress or monotony of real jobs when the goal of after-work hours is usually to unwind. after all, there are cosy games like stardew valley which promote the value of slowing down in a nurturing environment, with tasks like growing crops or foraging. the answer, according to experts, lies in the balance of challenge and control. assistant professor kean hsu from the national university of singapores psychology department said studies of human behaviour suggest that a moderate level of difficulty is optimal for engagement and performance. casual video games like work simulations often provide just enough challenge to keep someone on their toes rather than bored out of their minds, but not enough to make it feel overwhelming or impossible, said asst prof hsu, who is also a clinical psychologist. dr sng from ntu also pointed idea of the flow state, a term frequently referenced in gaming studies, where a player becomes deeply focused and engaged by the optimal balance of ease and challenge. while players might feel frustrated if tasks are too difficult, challenges are designed to help players achieve that flow state and develop a rewarding sense of competence. the way the game is designed is usually very progressive, so it allows people with different levels of flow to experience mastery at different points in time, said dr sng. that being said, he noted that people have different motivations for playing games, as some may prefer cosy games while others are looking for a challenge that provides a sense of achievement. he cited overcooked, a popular cooperative cooking simulation game, as an example of how players can experience a sense of mastery by successfully completing restaurant orders. however, for some, the game's competitive nature and time constraints may lead to stress that overshadows any feelings of achievement. while all this validates my tendency to immerse myself in work simulation games during my evenings, i also wondered if i am genuinely unwinding, or merely trading one form of stress for another. as enjoyable as it is to experiment with various virtual jobs, i cant shake the feeling that my growing hours spent managing my virtual pizzeria might not stem from a genuine passion for pizza. experts said that playing work simulation games in excess may become a cause for concern as a player risks avoidance of the root cause of stress from real-life challenges. asst prof hsu said that people may use games as a distraction to cope with negative emotions, as a persons stressors may feel beyond their control. however, this might be at the expense of neglecting opportunities to address the source of their stress and improve the situation at hand, though this could require time and effort. in those cases, leaning on games and other distractions may serve as a form of avoidance, prolonging these negative emotions and stress, even though it makes sense why folks might be leaning on these less productive forms of coping, said asst prof hsu. with simulated versions of work feeling more rewarding and less stressful than real life responsibilities, players may run the risk of prioritising the simulated work over ones actual responsibilities, said dr pooh. this becomes problematic when gaming interferes with important aspects of life, hampering work performance, relationships, physical health or well-being. for example, dr pooh said one sign of potential addiction would be when someone finds themselves becoming anxious or irritable when they cannot play the game, or finding themselves withdrawing from social connections. while there may be no fixed threshold for how many hours one should play before it crosses into addiction, dr pooh said the key to differentiating between a healthy gaming for relaxation or avoidance begins with confronting the question are you playing to unwind, or escape from problems youre not addressing? finding a balance and playing the games in moderation is crucial. when one is spending too much time playing such games, it will be helpful to be curious about why and how playing these games have served certain functions in their lives, said dr pooh. it might hold important messages about what one really needs to do in real life, such as addressing certain issues in order to gain more mastery and control over their lives.'' while writing this article about my moonlighting as a virtual pizza chef has allowed me to blend my gaming with my real-life responsibilities, it has also nudged me to reconsider the time i dedicate to my after hours work. a friend suggested i try a newsroom simulator for size, but i couldn't help but flinch at the thought of role-playing my actual job, managing virtual deadlines and juggling stories in addition stimulation and fulfilment my work already provides. and as my editor observed when i shared that

rules,CNA,Politics,Government Policies,26/10/2024 11:17,,,,"singapore mr lee hsien yang knows the inaccuracy of his claim about 38 oxley road, which he wants to be demolished, and is creating false urgency for it to be torn down immediately, the singapore government said on friday (oct 25). earlier in the day, mr lee, the youngest son of singapore's founding prime minister lee kuan yew, called on prime minister lawrence wong to make a decision on the property, saying in a facebook post that the time for that decision is now. in response, the singapore government said the late mr lee kuan yew had accepted that his family home at 38 oxley road may be preserved. mr lee kuan yew, who died in 2015, had written cabinet in 2011 acknowledging that they were of the view that the property should not be demolished. thereafter, having accepted that the property may be preserved, mr lee kuan yew also submitted renovation and redevelopment plans for the property, and obtained approval from ura (the urban redevelopment authority). this was in march 2012. mr lee kuan yew was, in submitting the plans, proceeding on the basis that the property will be preserved, said a singapore government spokesperson from the ministry of digital development and information (mddi). in pushing for the house to be torn down, mr lee hsien yang has repeatedly cited his father's last will, executed in 2013. the will stated that the late mr lee wanted the house to be demolished, and if that were not possible, the property should be closed to everyone except family and descendants. mr lee kuan yew's long-time lawyer was not involved in preparing the last will. in 2020, the court of three judges, led by the chief justice, found that mr lee hsien yang and his wife, mrs lee suet fern, had procured the execution of the last will with unseemly haste (that) can only be described as improper and unacceptable. a disciplinary tribunal also found mrs lee guilty of misconduct over the handling of mr lee kuan yews last will. on friday, the government spokesperson added that mr lee hsien yang chose not to mention that he and his wife had misled mr lee kuan yew on the execution of his last will. the couple were also found to have lied under oath. the disciplinary tribunal and the court of three judges said that mr lee hsien yang and mrs lee suet fern had presented an elaborate edifice of lies ... both on oath and through their public and other statements, the government spokesperson noted. the affidavits were contrived to present a false picture. several of the lies were quite blatant, the government spokesperson said. mr lee hsien yang's continued allegations must be seen in this light. the government added that it is trying to keep options open and give time for current and future generations of singaporeans to decide on what to do with the former home of the late mr lee. options include demolition or preservation of all or part of 38 oxley road. instead of closing all options now, we should keep the options open and consider them carefully, in the fullness of time, taking into account mr lee kuan yew's wishes, the historical value of the site and what it can mean for current and future generations of singaporeans, said the statement. mr lee hsien yang and his wife have been out of singapore since 2022 after deciding not to attend a scheduled police interview over potential offences of giving false evidence in judicial proceedings regarding the will of his father. he said on oct 22 that he is now a political refugee in the united kingdom after seeking asylum protection in 2022. in response to media queries from the guardian about mr lee's asylum status, the singapore government said there is no basis to allegations of a campaign of persecution against him as well as other claims about political repression in the country. mr lee kuan yew had on several occasions publicly expressed his wish for the house to be demolished after his death. he said in a letter cabinet in october 2010 that it should not be kept as a kind of relic for people to tramp through and that it has no merit as architecture. in his book hard truths to keep singapore going, published in january 2011, he was quoted as saying because of my house the neighbouring houses cannot build high. now demolish my house and change the planning rules, go up, the land value will go up. he reiterated his stance in july 2011 in another letter cabinet, but was met with opposition from ministers when he asked them about it. subsequently, in another letter cabinet in december 2011, mr lee said he had reflected on the matter after the cabinet was unanimous in saying the property should not be demolished and that he had decided that if it was to be preserved, work needed to be carried out. cabinet members were unanimous that 38 oxley road should not be demolished. i have reflected on this and decided that if 38 oxley road is to be preserved, it needs to have its foundations reinforced and the whole building refurbished. it must then be let out for people to live in. an empty building will soon decline and decay, he said. mr lee kuan yew's will, while stating his preference for the property to be demolished, also acknowledges that the property may be preserved, the government said on friday. mr lee kuan yew's views are quite clear. his preference was for the property to be demolished. but he accepted that it need not be demolished, and he gave his views on how the property ought to be preserved. all of this is set out in the report of the ministerial committee on 38 oxley road, published in april 2018, it added. the national heritage board (nhb) on thursday said it would study the oxley road site to assess if it is worthy of being preserved as a national monument. mr lee hsien yang applied to ura on oct 21 to carry out the demolition works, about two weeks after his sister dr lee wei ling died. she had been living in the house before her death. demolishing 38 oxley road now will rule out a proper and full consideration of the options presented in the 2018 ministerial committee report, said the board. minister for culture, community and youth edwin tong wrote in a facebook post on thursday that we do not think that any option should be precluded, or closed off, at this stage. it is important that we approach the matter with an open mind, as well as keep our options open. the passage of time will help us better appreciate the matter in its proper context, with the benefit of some hindsight. the study will be conducted by nhb's preservation of sites and monuments advisory board, which includes experts from various sectors. nhb will then submit its recommendation minister for culture, community and youth to decide whether to issue a preservation order for the site under the preservation of monuments act. if the minister intends to preserve the site, nhb will notify the owner and occupier to submit any objections within a reasonable period before the minister makes a final decision. if the government decides to preserve the site as a national monument, all options for its fate will remain open to current and future governments, said nhb. a preservation order can be amended or revoked and no rezoning or alternative use of the site will be allowed until a decision is made in the future, it

rules,CNA,Health,Mental Health,26/10/2024 6:46,1.329081,103.7761967,King Albert Park,"many women shy away from talking about menopause, despite it being a natural and inevitable part of life. valery tan, the 27-year-old co-founder of surety, a menopause platform in singapore, wants to change that. menopause should be part of our daily conversations, she said. so what started as a venture builder programme for the singapore university of social sciences (suss) undergraduate in human resource management has become a business that is organising a menopause festival in november. surety is a social impact startup that tan and her co-founder elmer yap, a final-year supply chain management student at suss, are looking to turn into a social enterprise. the initial focus was on womens health in general, particularly around contraceptives. however, tan quickly realised that the field of contraception was saturated with many players and surety needed a more distinct unique selling point. it was around this time that tans mother, now 53, shared with her how she hadnt had her period for six months and was experiencing symptoms such as mood swings and hot flushes, which took a toll on her emotionally and physically. watching her go through this was hard, tan, an only child, said. also, neither of us fully understood what was happening at first. it was not just about the physical symptoms i realised how much it was affecting her quality of life, her self-confidence and even our relationship. it made tan realise how little we talk about menopause and how important it is for families to be part of the conversation. it impacts nearly half the population, yet it is rarely discussed openly, especially in asia, she said. she set about reading up on menopause and perimenopause but these were mostly western resources. the cultural nuances and specific challenges faced by women in asia, particularly in conservative societies like singapore, were often missing. this gap was a huge motivator for me, tan told cna women. i wanted to create something that felt culturally relevant for asian women, something that could offer the same level of support and information but in a way that resonates with our cultural context. that conversation with her mum was the spark that inspired her to pivot surety to menopause care, she added. by the end of 2022, we had fully committed to building a platform that focuses on supporting women through menopause, which is now suretys core mission. surety offers a range of services, from community events to corporate wellness programmes, and is in the process of developing its app, pauseplay, to provide digital support for women navigating menopause. the platforms events cover topics such as relationships, holistic wellness and medical advice. this is because menopause is not a one-dimensional issue and it affects every aspect of a womans life, from physical health to mental well-being, and even how she functions in the workplace, said tan. while there are doctors who discuss the medical aspects of menopause, including hormone therapy, symptom management and overall health during this phase of life, suretys events also touch on less clinical but equally important topics such as workplace wellness and holistic midlife wellness. this ensures that were addressing the whole woman not just focusing on symptoms but also on how menopause affects their relationships, careers and mental health, tan explained. surety began as part of a venture builder programme at suss. when tan received the ngee ann kongsi - suss impact grant in 2022, surety had to be turned into a company, as part of the rules. the company later received a start-up founder grant from enterprise singapore in 2024. the two co-founders have taken a leave of absence from university since june 2024 to work on surety full-time. tan has one semester left to complete her degree. tan has always had an entrepreneurial streak. in secondary school, she sold limited-edition air jordan sneakers on community marketplace carousell. during the pandemic, she launched an instagram page to showcase home-based businesses. while she admitted she doesnt have first-hand experience with menopause being in her twenties tan stressed her personal connection cause, having seen what her mother has gone through. she sees having a young team as an advantage in getting the message across and make the conversation around menopause more approachable. by integrating a more modern, tech-savvy approach, were also reaching the daughters, colleagues and younger family members of women going through menopause, helping them understand how they can offer support, she said. tan revealed that the general reaction to suretys work has been overwhelmingly positive, but theres still a long way to go in terms of open dialogue. one thing that has surprised her is that middle-aged women are not as shy as she perceived. in singapore, many women still find it uncomfortable to talk about menopause, largely because its seen as taboo or as something too private to discuss publicly, she said. however, once we start these conversations, ive noticed a sense of relief among many women they want to talk about it, they just dont always know how to start. the younger generation, too, is becoming more receptive to discussing womens health issues but, overall, theres still a lot of learning and unlearning that needs to happen. suretys mission is to help foster that dialogue and remove the stigma surrounding menopause, she added. surety is gearing up for its biggest event yet the menopause festival 2024, which takes place on nov 9. it brings together experts, healthcare providers and women from all walks of life to talk openly about menopause, with panel discussions, interactive sessions and networking opportunities. this event is for women going through menopause and for their families, friends and colleagues, tan said. its about normalising the conversation and providing the tools and support systems women need to navigate this stage of life. tans vision is for surety to become the go-to platform for womens health in asia, starting with menopause. i see this venture as a long-term one we wont change all of asia with one menopause festival, but elmer and i have been heartened by the response and were really excited to continue with this, she said. so what does her mother think of the cause she inspired? part of her doesnt understand why im into venture building because she feels i should be graduating from school and just getting a job, she said. im sure shes proud of me but its definitely a career trajectory she didnt think id get into. my mother has been such a huge inspiration for me and the work im doing with surety. surety exists because of her story and im incredibly grateful for that. cna women is a section on cna lifestyle that seeks to inform, empower and inspire the modern woman. if you have women-related news, issues and ideas to share with us, email cnawomenmediacorp.com.sg.",1
rules,CNA,Politics,Military Defense,25/10/2024 16:33,1.2966426,103.7763939,Kent Ridge,"singapore during the ongoing trial of workers party (wp) chief pritam singh for allegedly lying before a committee of privileges, a former party cadre was called up as a witness. the term will once again pop up in the news next month, when cadres from the ruling peoples action party (pap) convene for their party conference. there has been much online chatter from curious netizens wondering just what a cadre is. singapores four biggest political parties the pap, wp, progress singapore party (psp) and singapore democratic party (sdp) all follow a cadre system of party organisation. according oxford english dictionary, the word cadre came about in the late 1700s. it has its roots in french, referring to a group of military officers in charge of training the rest of the unit. in the 19th century, cadre parties developed in european politics and dominated the political landscape, using electoral and parliamentary means to exercise power in a period of great social and economic upheaval. in a political context, cadres are people trained, typically in socialist states, to carry out the goals of the party-state and to spread and enforce the official ideology. for instance, the african national congress in south africa, which has governed since the end of apartheid in 1994, deploys cadres in strategic positions at various levels of government. chinas communist party has about 40 million cadres across the country, placed in positions in the party, state, military, business and other organisations. the cadre system was introduced insingapore political landscape because early leaders like lee kuan yew and david marshall were educated in the united kingdom and exposed politics there, noted nus associate professor of political science bilveer singh. they then brought back what they learnt and socialised the concept insingapore system in the 1950s, he said. assistant professor elvin ong, from the national university of singapore's political science department, said a cadre system helps a party maintain its internal organisational coherence, in terms of ideology, loyalty and discipline over the medium to long term. it is a tiered membership system that prevents hostile takeovers, said associate professor daniel goh, associate provost for undergraduate education at the national university of singapore and a former non-constituency mp from the wp. it is a good thing to maintain a degree of stability for a democracy built around political parties competing with each other for electoral votes. he noted that, for instance, the paps cadre system was introduced in 1958 after an attempt by left-wing members to gain control of the party. the wp too has been a cadre party since its formation in 1957, said assoc prof singh. asst prof ong said we should expect party leaders to only select members who profess to believe in the partys mission to be cadres. promoted cadre members who are entrusted with the voting rights are, in turn, expected to be more loyal party and less susceptible to defection than ordinary members. cadres are also expected to act in accordance with instructions from the party leadership, and be less fickle than ordinary members, said asst prof ong. this will help the party be more resilient to electoral setbacks in the short term and survive over the longer term. the constitutions of some political parties here provide an insight into what a cadre member does. cadre members have the right to cast votes for the partys central executive committee (cec). this means they hold the power to decide who enters the partys highest decision-making body. they are also eligible to stand for election cec themselves. members who have proved their loyalty and service principles and objectives of the party and members who, in the opinion of the central executive committee, are fit and proper

least once in two years, during which cadres will elect the partys executive body, while guided by the need for diverse representation. special conferences can also be called at any time by the chairman or a cec member, or 10 per cent of the cadre membership or at least 20 cadre members of the party (whichever is higher), it states. one was expected to contribute cause by participating and volunteering actively in party grassroots activities, party-building work, supporting the mps for their parliamentary work and election campaigns, said assoc prof goh. workers' party has around 100 cadres, according to former members. assoc prof goh estimated that about a third of the party members are cadres. in the sdp, cadres are appointed by the cec typically in small, carefully curated batches once every two years, in tandem with the ordinary party conference cycle, a spokesperson told cna. the party currently has slightly over 50 cadres, forming around 15 per cent of the partys membership, the spokesperson added. there are no publicly available lists of cadres for any of the parties. it is confidential and quite closely held, and understandably so, as it represents the inner circle of the party, said a pap member, who has been a cadre for about six years. it is possible that some members do not even know that another is a cadre. those who become cadres do not have to pay additional membership fees. the sdp spokesperson said party cadres are usually long-serving members whose contributions have been deemed suitably valuable well-being of the party. there is no fixed duration they have to be an ordinary member for, but the appointment would have to be approved by the majority of the cec, said the spokesperson. for pap, there seem to be no fixed rules to qualify for cadreship, but what the party looks out for is consistency and effort, said a cadre. ultimately, the cadres are the ones who choose the cec, so they have to be trusted. in a sense, they are the more senior members of the party and form the inner core of the rank-and-file, he said. pap cadres told cna it typically takes at least five years for a member to become a cadre. the former wp cadre who took the stand in mr singhs trial, mr yudhishthra nathan, had been in the party for six years before he left in 2022. he became an ordinary member in early 2016, before becoming a cadre in the middle of that same year. assoc prof goh, who left the wp in may last year, said the duration it takes for one to become a cadre varies, as it depends on each members contribution and trust from the cec, adding that his was quite fast. i suppose the cec believed that i contributed significantly 2011 ge and as a grassroots and policy research volunteer for around two years after it. the reasons were not explicitly given when i was elected as cadre member in early 2013, he said. the pap cadre explained every now and then, theres a nomination for cadre membership, and branch chairs and branch secretaries will make their recommendations. these assessments are based on the members performance during branch and party activities, such as general election campaigns. the pap regularly refreshes the cadre ranks, so as to inject fresh blood, which also naturally replaces long-serving members who pass on, said the cadre. any cadre member who is absent for two consecutive party conferences without having given prior notice may have his cadre membership terminated by the central executive committee, the paps constitution states. the member will have an opportunity to explain his or her absence cec. if the cadreship is eventually terminated, then the member returns to being an ordinary member, it says. editor's note an earlier version of this article said 3,000 cadres attended pap's conference in november 2022. it should be 3,000 members. we apologise for the error. the article has also been updated after sdp advised that information it provided about cadre appointments needing

committee of privileges, a former party cadre was called up as a witness. the term will once again pop up in the news next month, when cadres from the ruling peoples action party (pap) convene for their party conference. there has been much online chatter from curious netizens wondering just what a cadre is. singapores four biggest political parties the pap, wp, progress singapore party (psp) and singapore democratic party (sdp) all follow a cadre system of party organisation. according oxford english dictionary, the word cadre came about in the late 1700s. it has its roots in french, referring to a group of military officers in charge of training the rest of the unit. in the 19th century, cadre parties developed in european politics and dominated the political landscape, using electoral and parliamentary means to exercise power in a period of great social and economic upheaval. in a political context, cadres are people trained, typically in socialist states, to carry out the goals of the party-state and to spread and enforce the official ideology. for instance, the african national congress in south africa, which has governed since the end of apartheid in 1994, deploys cadres in strategic positions at various levels of government. chinas communist party has about 40 million cadres across the country, placed in positions in the party, state, military, business and other organisations. the cadre system was introduced insingapore political landscape because early leaders like lee kuan yew and david marshall were educated in the united kingdom and exposed politics there, noted nus associate professor of political science bilveer singh. they then brought back what they learnt and socialised the concept insingapore system in the 1950s, he said. assistant professor elvin ong, from the national university of singapore's political science department, said a cadre system helps a party maintain its internal organisational coherence, in terms of ideology, loyalty and discipline over the medium to long term. it is a tiered membership system that prevents hostile takeovers, said associate professor daniel goh, associate provost for undergraduate education at the national university of singapore and a former non-constituency mp from the wp. it is a good thing to maintain a degree of stability for a democracy built around political parties competing with each other for electoral votes. he noted that, for instance, the paps cadre system was introduced in 1958 after an attempt by left-wing members to gain control of the party. the wp too has been a cadre party since its formation in 1957, said assoc prof singh. asst prof ong said we should expect party leaders to only select members who profess to believe in the partys mission to be cadres. promoted cadre members who are entrusted with the voting rights are, in turn, expected to be more loyal party and less susceptible to defection than ordinary members. cadres are also expected to act in accordance with instructions from the party leadership, and be less fickle than ordinary members, said asst prof ong. this will help the party be more resilient to

lakeside - is a 20-minute bus ride away, said mr lim. this attests that convenience is king, especially as singapore receives more infrastructure upgrades and people grow used convenience of a nearby mrt station, he added. most of the flat types offered under the plus and prime projects in areas such as ang mo kio, bedok, geylang and kallangwhampoa, were oversubscribed, in line with analysts' expectations. the most sought-after among these projects was central trio amk, which drew 1,763 applications for 267 four-room units. the application rate among first-timer families was 4.1, meaning there were about four applicants vying for each such unit. the four-room units in other plus and prime projects had between two and three first-time applicants for each unit. the sustained enthusiasm even with stricter resale conditions on plus and prime flats suggests that buyers could be focusing on affordability and location over resale flexibility, said eras mr lim. the 146 three-room flats in kallangwhampoa yielded a lukewarm application rate of 0.9 among first-timer families. this could be due to young couples who intend to start a family being hesitant to commit to an extended minimum occupation period in a smaller flat, mr lim added. kallangwhampoa had two plus projects and one prime project on offer for this exercise. the four-room offerings across all three projects attracted a first-time application rate of 2.8. this was higher than the application rate of 2.4 for tanjong rhu i and ii - the two projects launched under the prime location public housing (plh) model during the june sales exercise, noted propnex ceo ismail gafoor. similarly, the plus projects in bedok also performed better than nearby projects that were launched in february's bto sales exercise. then, the bto projects - bedok south bloom and bedok north springs - drew an application rate of 2.8 times. we think this is an early indication of the buy-in for the plus and prime flat types which carry tighter restrictions, longer minimum occupation period and subsidy clawback on resale, said mr gafoor. it suggests that many buyers both first-timers and second-timers - are willing to commit long-term to their flat, and that the additional restrictions are not a dampener on their buying decision, especially if the bto project is in a choice location. the october sales exercise also marked the first time that eligible singles can apply for two-room flexi flats in any location. previously, they could only apply for such flats in non-mature estates. this pent-up demand contributed to a surge in applications this time, with first-time singles making up about 20 per cent of the applications, the hdb said earlier this week. huttons asia estimated that the relaxing of bto rules for singles could have led to an additional 6,000 applications this time. this increase was expected and showed the level of pent-up demand from singles. it may take at least five years before this demand is satisfied, said its senior director of data analytics lee sze teck, among the nearly 2,000 flats available across seven bto projects, bukit batok saw the highest application rate among first-time singles. more than 36 first-time single applicants were vying for each of the 130 two-room flexi units by the time the sales exercise ended. such flats in ang mo kio, kallangwhampoa and pasir ris were also popular with singles, with application rates ranging from 26.3 to 29.5.",1

rules,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,22/10/2024 19:54,1.3335251,103.959537,Expo,"singapore the singapore government has blocked 10 websites set up by foreign actors which authorities said could be used to mount hostile information campaigns (hics) here. the websites have been observed to masquerade as singapore websites by spoofing or using terms associated with the country in their domain name, while incorporating familiar local features and visuals, the ministry of home affairs (mha) and infocomm media development authority (imda) said on tuesday (oct 22). they also carried content on singapore, some of which were generated by artificial intelligence (ai), the organisations added in a joint press release. these are common tactics used by malicious foreign actors build websites which can attract a local following, that may subsequently be used as platforms to mount hics. it is therefore in the public interest to disable access 10 inauthentic websites for users in singapore, by issuing directions under the broadcasting act. in response to media queries, mha said investigations show that no singaporeans are involved in operating any of the websites, and that none of the websites has mounted a hic against singapore. the level of exposure of singaporeans to these 10 websites is assessed to be currently low. however, the websites could potentially be used to mount hics against singapore in the future, the ministry added. the government is also reviewing the foreign interference (countermeasures) act (fica), to see how it could be used to take preemptive action against websites. fica was used in july to block nearly 100 social media accounts linked to exiled chinese billionaire guo wengui. the blocked websites are as of 5pm, access to all 10 has been disabled. most of them are associated with global networks of inauthentic news websites previously identified by cybersecurity researchers to have conducted hics and influence campaigns in other countries, said mha and imda. two of them www.zaobaodaily.com and www.singaporeinfomap.com have domain names closely related or similar to legitimate singapore-related websites. for instance, the official website of lianhe zaobao, singapore's largest chinese-language newspaper, is actually www.zaobao.com.sg. the content on these sites may hence mislead audiences into thinking they reflect official positions or local sentiments in singapore, said the two government agencies. the two sites are also allegedly part of a network linked to shanghai haixun technology, a chinese public relations firm, according to research by google-owned cybersecurity firm mandiant in 2023. a year earlier, mandiant found that websites in this network present themselves primarily as independent news outlets from different regions across the world and publish content in 11 languages, in what researchers dubbed the haienergy influence operation. mandiant found that the campaign leveraged services and infrastructure belonging to haixun to host and distribute content, with 72 websites used to target audiences across north america, europe, the middle east and asia. it has carried content criticising the united states and its allies while supporting the chinese governments reform of hong kongs electoral system. among the other blocked websites, seven have the word singapore or associated terms including singapura, singdao and lioncity in their domain name, and publish content related country. they carried content which was identical to that carried by another foreign newswire which appears to have conducted hics and influence campaigns against other countries, mha and imda noted. these seven sites belong to a network under public relations firm seaprwire, according to press releases issued by the firm itself. and the sites have run articles that were replicated across each other as well as on the timesnewswire website, which has a strategic partnership with seaprwire according latter. digital threat research group the citizen lab reported earlier this year that timesnewswire also features prominently in an influence campaign involving at least 123 websites operating in china, but posing as local news outlets in 30 countries across europe, asia, and latin america to spread pro-beijing disinformation. the campaign draws much of its content from timesnewswire, with around 100 domains linking back entity - which has also been associated with the haienergy operation. the last website, alamak.io, masquerades as a singaporean site by using the local colloquial expression as its domain name, and carrying singapore-related news which paraphrases local media articles. this includes those from singapore news outlets cna and the straits times, whose articles have been, in some cases, repurposed for the inauthentic site. investigations found that the majority of the articles published on this website were likely to have been written with al tools, said mha and imda. this website also published commentaries on sociopolitical issues, including one that falsely alleged that singapore had allowed other countries to conduct their biological warfare research activities here. the alamak.io domain name is registered in russia, according whois internet database. the website has also carried several articles written by russia's ambassador to singapore nikolay kudashev, on issues such as russia-asean relations and with headlines like replacing the rules-based neocolonial framework. mha and imda added that there were currently no provisions in the foreign interference (countermeasures) act of 2021 to preemptively act against websites, whether inauthentic or not. for example, an account restriction direction, which is an anticipatory direction, can only be given to a provider of a social media service andor electronic service but not websites, they said. the government is reviewing the act to see how this can be addressed. the authorities urged singaporeans to remain vigilant when consuming content online, and to be alert to such inauthentic websites and the threat they pose. there are many overseas cases where malicious foreign actors had created and used inauthentic news websites to propagate false narratives to sway the target population's sentiments, in order to advance their own interests, they said. they do so by inciting social tension, exploiting societal fault lines, manipulating elections, or undermining confidence and trust in public institutions.",0

rules,CNA,Health,Public Health,21/10/2024 9:30,,,,"singapore two significant changes to singapores healthcare financing framework were announced in recent weeks adjustments of the means testing for healthcare subsidies, and the raising of medishield life premiums by as much as 35 per cent. the first announcement caused hardly a ripple, despite the health ministry maintaining that up to 1.1 million singaporeans and permanent residents (prs) would benefit from the changes that kicked in from oct 1. the second, though, saw some consternation and confusion about whether this hike, set to take effect from april 2025, also applies to premiums for integrated shield plans. (the answer is no, although its likely the private sector will follow suit, given that the moratorium on premium increases has expired.) even the medishield life review committee dwelt at length on public incomprehension when members were gathering feedback in its 2024 report most participants had heard about medishield life but did not know that it was the national health insurance scheme. many also did not have a good understanding of the scheme and its parameters. nevertheless, it says a lot for the trust people have in the state that on the whole, there was little public reaction changes. the average singaporean tends to take the maths minutiae for granted. the most common questions we ask are also the most basic ones can use medisave? or can medishield cover it? eyes are usually only opened when were confronted with a medical bill. to be fair, wading through each new confusing stream of numbers requires, first of all, an understanding of how the healthcare system in singapore works. it would be a wonder if anyone besides an industry expert could manage it, even if we tried. all the same, lets try. in singapores healthcare system, what youre entitled to financially depends on several things, including the colour of your community health assist scheme (chas) card (if youve applied for one), the amount in your medisave, what generation you belong to, whether you have private insurance, and so on. it also depends on how your household fares under the means testing framework of monthly household income per capita. this is sometimes known as the national means testing framework, which also applies to social and educational help programmes. thats where the latest changes make a difference to how much financial help you get with your healthcare needs. heres a quick primer. first, some healthcare subsidies are entitlements - theyre for every citizen and pr, with more for the pink ic holder. these include hospitalisation in c and b2 ward classes, specialist outpatient clinics and polyclinic outpatient treatment. now this entitlement has been extended to some types of palliative care for the terminally ill. for hospitalisation, whether in acute or community hospital, anyone can choose the cheapest option which has the greatest amount of subsidies, regardless of age or income. but to prevent overconsumption by those who can pay their own way, means testing is employed for different income bands. those with per capita household income below s$2,100 will get the topmost 80 per cent subsidy, while those in the highest income tier with more than s$3,600 will get at most 50 per cent. these changes dont require any work on the individuals part. the system automatically churns out new numbers as and when you need healthcare treatment. second, other subsidies come with means tests that would disqualify the better off. individuals must apply for these, like the home caregiving grant or seniors mobility and enabling fund. if there is no household income, the annual value of the property comes inpicture, dissected into different levels. housing and development board (hdb) households would make the mark, but not all private homes - a bugbear for retirees who live on landed property. (the october changes did not mention property values.) the irony of this is that it makes better financial sense for the elderly to live on their own. in this demographic, a retiree with no working adult living with them in an hdb flat is best placed to get the greatest subsidies. third, compulsory insurance programmes like medishield life and careshield life are a whole different category. premiums are drawn from individual medisave accounts depending on age bands, with the younger folks paying less than older. the assurance is that as premiums go up, so will subsidy levels. theres also the promise of medisave top-ups from the government. if youve made it through all that, youd likely agree that singapores safety net for healthcare is strong, but patchworked. policies and schemes seem to be continually added one on top of the other with overlaps, different eligibility criteria and changing terms. its a never-ending game of catch-up, and the rules are always changing. on the outpatient front, for example, some drugs and chronic ailments are more heavily subsidised than others, but its a dynamic list due to medical improvements and changing patient profiles. then there are medisave withdrawal limits that do not depend on how much you have in your medisave account. another conflicting cluster in the patchwork for stays in acute and community hospitals, there are seven income bands with subsidies from 50 per cent to 80 per cent. but at specialist outpatient clinics, treatment subsidies are divided into five bands with the highest income level, tagged at s$7,000, getting a subsidy of at least 30 per cent. come january 2026, a deductible for outpatient fees will be included on top of co-payment, which will no longer be 10 per cent across the board but levied in graduated form. how will this new patch be sewn on top of the rest? over the years, attempts have been made to simplify this patchwork. a start has been made with acute and community hospitals - which makes the new elements in outpatient fees puzzling. its tempting to suggest that the whole system be torn down and built up again based on just one or two principles. but in healthcare, there are too many factors at play that are sometimes contradictory, like an individuals ability to pay and a citizens right to care options for the best possible clinical outcomes. with finite national resources, the state is caught between promising a basic level of healthcare for all, while ensuring that the most money goes to those most in financial need. that calculus also includes the increasing involvement of the private sector and community-based organisations, which can claim government subsidies, even as they offer different service standards and charge different rates. another example private insurers that offer integrated shield plans tagged on to medishield life. the result is differences in insurance premiums, types of coverage and choice of doctors and medications - a boon for the discerning consumer, but a mess for the masses. with health insurance, cost and, perhaps, time taken for claims to be paid out are really the only things a layperson can immediately grapple with. already, there are calls for government intervention and regulation in this market. the combination of state subsidy, choice, checks and competition makes the system even more complex. from an administrators point of view, our healthcare framework would be nuanced. to a consumer looking for help, the word would simply be confusing. its simply too difficult for us to comprehend all its working parts, even when we try. we simply have to trust, willingly or unwillingly, that someone somewhere is looking out for our interests in getting the help were eligible for. far easier and more convenient to bestow trust on institutions - and grumble only when the bill arrives. bertha henson, a former journalist, is the author of when mama fell, an e-book available for free reading at www.whenmamafell.com. this article was adapted from the last chapter of the book.",1

rules,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3483099,103.6831347,Pioneer,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm, ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1

need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1
rules,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3555189,103.7308145,Tengah,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm, ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits

ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1
rules,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3483099,103.6831347,Pioneer,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm,

produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading

impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to

rules,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3495907,103.9567879,Tampines West,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm, ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to

singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1
rules,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3367679,103.6941672,Pioneer,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm, ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in

that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300

fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1
regulations,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3495907,103.9567879,Tampines West,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm, ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent

produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1
regulations,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3367679,103.6941672,Pioneer,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm, ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said

promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here.

cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1
regulations,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3495907,103.9567879,Tampines West,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm, ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed

tuas in april 2024. sky greens is also scaling down its operations, with many of its greenhouses reportedly torn down. worldwide, vertical farm startups with once-high valuations such as agricool, kalera and aerofarms have also faced heavy losses and filed for bankruptcy, in part due to unsustainable business models. venture capital investments inagri-tech space have fallen by 60 per cent since late 2021. in the aquaculture space, things have not gone swimmingly either for local firms. barramundi group, which sold 9.5 per cent of locally produced fish in 2020, stopped stocking its three ocean-based farm sites with juvenile fish in june 2023 due to a deadly fish virus outbreak. compounding the bleak mood surrounding the local farming scene are reports that singapores fourth egg farm, ifh, may be reconsidering the viability of setting up its operations here. the singapore food agency (sfa) said in response to cna today's queries that it has been working closely with ifh to help it set up the farm. there was also recent news that developmental work for the lim chu kang masterplan an initiative to redevelop about 390 hectares of land there into a high-productivity agri-food zone has been delayed. but there are also bright sparks businesses that have managed to succeed by either carving a niche for themselves or diversifying their revenue streams by going beyond just selling produce. mr ray poh, the founder of local indoor farm artisan green, for instance, said his firm consistently rolls out products with more demand than supply in the market, like baby spinach, leading to a sustainable business. they have broken even on their vegetable farm and are in the midst of building a bigger one in sungei tengah which will be operational in 2025. nonetheless, such encouraging stories are few and far between, raising questions whether singapore can create a viable high-tech agricultural sector that will help reduce its reliance on food imports. as 2030 looms over the horizon, cna today looks at why it is difficult for agri-tech firms here to succeed, and the role that high-tech farming can play in singapores ongoing quest for food security in the future. one reason agri-tech consultant mr wong discourages those without industry knowledge from starting a farm here is that he knows how tough it is to make the economics work. only about 1 per cent of land is set aside for agricultural use in singapore. in 2023, the island had a total of 254 licensed local food farms, comprising primarily hen shell egg (three), vegetable (115) and seafood farms (131). as such, much of the nations focus has been on identifying alternative spaces to produce food and using creative technologies to increase farm productivity. singapore invested almost s$250 million in the industry in 2019, when the 30-by-30 goal was announced. two years later, the sfa established a s$60 million agri-food cluster transformation (act) fund to support the transformation of the agri-food sector. the act fund provides a co-funding quantum for the adoption of technology and advanced farming systems, and support to implement technology to make efficient use of resources such as water and energy. but despite this and the number of land-based seafood and vegetable farms increasing slightly from 2022 to 2023, overall local production of seafood and vegetables decreased by 8 and 15 per cent respectively over the same time period. why such paltry returns despite the hefty investments? owners and operators of seafood and vegetable farms attributed it to a slew of challenges that both industries face. cna today spoke to nine local farms which use some form of technology to improve their productivity, and almost half said that they are still looking to break even from their initial investments. to begin with, operating costs in singapore are higher compared with neighbouring countries due to expensive land leases, electricity and labour. vertical vegetable farms, for instance, require advanced equipment such as sensors and hydroponic set-ups and rely on energy-intensive systems such as artificial lighting and climate control. these hardware investments, combined with the need for highly skilled labour to manage and optimise the farms, make vertical farming a costly venture, said ms eyleen goh, the founder and director of sg veg farms. as a result, farms here have had to keep their headcounts lean. ms grace lim, the co-founder and director of urban farming partners singapore, told cna today that she only hires three full-time employees to help run her indoor vertical farm, grograce, a 430 sqm warehouse in penjuru, jurong. grograce, which opened in november 2022 and is capable of growing 32 different varieties of vegetables, uses patented dutch technologies and rainwater to grow its crops, while also recycling the water used. even then, she said, the farm is still in the red. for its part, the sfa enhanced the act fund in 2020 to increase the co-funding quantum and make it available to a wider range of food types. it also introduced the energy efficiency programme in 2023, offering farms co-funding to undergo energy efficiency audits and adopt more energy efficient technologies. but with the exception of a 20 per cent cash advance for technology upscaling, such grants are paid on a reimbursement basis, which causes problems for farms without large amounts of capital on hand. some fish farms told cna today that they are seeking cash injections to stay afloat, but securing funding has not been easy in the past year due to a series of industry red flags that have been widely reported. dr dirk eichelberger, the chief executive of singapore aquaculture technologies, pointed to barramundi groups decision to stop farming in singapore and focus instead on its operations in brunei as an example. if the biggest player in your industry (barramundi group) applies for a moratorium which means you have to refinance your company it doesnt inspire confidence in with investors, he said. the banks are not very keen to invest in aquaculture either, to put it mildly. ultimately, the main problem that local farms face across the board is the lack of consumer demand. with high operational costs and limited ability to scale, farms here are forced to price their produce higher than similar goods imported from overseas, and singapores consumers do not seem to value local produce enough to pay a premium. this is also of concern even for the local egg farming industry, which in 2023 already contributed more than 30 per cent to singapores total egg consumption. mr chew zi xuan, the general manager of chews agriculture, one of singapores three egg farms, is unsure whether local farms can maintain that market share. our concern is not about production, its whether the demand for locally produced eggs can be kept up, he said. mr chew noted that while his 20-hectare farm along neo tiew road has the capability to produce a million eggs a day, they often produce only 85 to 90 per cent of that figure because they would not be able to sell all of their eggs otherwise. in response to cna today's queries, sfa said it is working with the singapore agro-food enterprises federation limited (safef) to increase demand for local produce. safef has been partnering farmers, traders, and food processing companies to promote local produce and has also taken on the role of an industry level supply and demand aggregator to better match demand and supply, it said. sfa added that locally grown vegetables and fish are now sold under the brand names the straits fish and the sg farmers market respectively at fairprice supermarkets under a six-month trial, and that consumer response to these products have been encouraging. the chief executive of another local egg farm, n&n agriculture, mr ma chin chew believes the government is doing their part to promote local produce, but also that in the current economic situation, people care more about the price. industry players pointed out that the overemphasis on technology for technologys sake has contributed failure of some high-profile farming ventures here. several farmers cited temasek-backed fish farmer apollo aquacultures move to build an eight-storey facility which requires a high amount of energy to pump water upwards against the pull of gravity as one of these poor technology-driven decisions. apollo was initially projected to produce 2,700 tonnes of fish a year, but went into judicial management back in february 2023. the straits times reported on thursday that two companies have conditionally agreed to purchase its farming facility. but mr poh of artisan green believes that the spate of farm closures is ultimately beneficial for the local agri-tech scene. now, people are more aware that (food production) is not just a straightforward problem to solve and that there are intrinsic challenges that come with being in the food industry, he said. this change in expectations will result in managing investors' goals and making sure farms are more focused on the actual operations instead of chasing technology for the sake of increasing (the companys) valuation. another thing that farmers would like more understanding from the government. one example of a shining light in high-tech farming here exists at the tampines round market and food centre, where an unassuming grey shipping container sits, seemingly idle, a few feet away from the car park. but it is, in fact, singapores first urban fish farm in a container, dubbed our fish storey, developed by local startup aqualita ecotechnology and supported by temasek foundation. the container utilises a recirculating aquaculture system (ras), a technology that reduces water wastage by recycling it, while simultaneously keeping water conditions controllable and preventing diseases for its fish. mr goh chin heng, aqualitas director of technology, said this is perfect for land-scarce and expensive singapore. the 6m-by-2.5m container is capable of producing up to 700 kg of jade perch (around 1,000 fishes) at any time with a survival rate of more than 90 per cent an extremely productive return for a small space. the container was designed to be modular, such that it can be stacked up, and maintaining the farm takes up no more than half an hour each day. it also uses a mere 1.5 kilowatts of electricity per hour. to bake a cake with your household oven, in comparison, needs 3 kilowatts, noted mr goh. as part of a partnership with tampines town council, the fish farm was first unveiled public in november 2023, and in june 2024, aqualita sold about 100kg of jade perch at cost price to local fishmongers. at a glance, aqualitas container farm appears to be a potentially commercially viable solution to singapores seafood production utilising technology to overcome land constraints, energy costs and the biosecurity concerns associated with traditional fish farms to bring fresh seafood market next door. but even this success story faces its fair share of challenges. as mr goh explained, government agencies have a host of stringent regulations that farms have to abide by. while he views these strict rules as ultimately a good thing, adhering to them can be both time-consuming and costly. for instance, one of the requirements for the tampines project was to build a concrete base underneath the container farm, which mr goh said cost more than building the unit itself. such regulations drive up costs and inadvertently affect the price of fish sold, making it harder to compete with cheaper fish imports. nevertheless, aqualita views itself more as a solution provider than a farm, and mr goh said that our fish storey's container systems are seeing demand from overseas proof that there is value in technologies developed here. ms victoria yoong, co-founder of the tech-enabled fish farm atlas aquaculture, believes in the government's emphasis on technology but noted that high-tech need not mean the most complicated, fancy-looking or expensive equipment. for example, her two-hectare farm in sungei tengah, which began operations in 2020, uses their own high tech, low energy ras that is fully sustainable and has zero discharge. ms yoong said the farm grows about seven types of seafood for commercial reasons, though it is able to grow a much larger variety. for us, tech is more engineering and understanding the science of water than gadgets that automate things, ms yoong said. while the problems faced by high-tech farms here do not bode well for the sector, some industry players said it is unrealistic to expect singapore to be an agri-tech powerhouse within a short span of time. others, like dr paul teng, professor and adjunct senior fellow at nanyang technological universitys s. rajaratnam school of international studies, believe that singapore should acknowledge its limitations and double down on its strategy of strengthening and diversifying its supply chain of food imports instead. sfa said in response to queries that the nation's key strategy to enhance its food security is indeed import source diversification singapore has increased its food supply sources from 183 countries or regions in 2022 to 187 in 2023. it added that it is committed to support the local agri-food sector to build its capability and capacity to produce food locally, which will mitigate the volatility and impact of global food supply chains. dr farshad shishehchian, the co-founder of blue aqua international, said that the nations nascent industry, coupled with its unique limitations in size and regulations, creates complex problems for farm owners. for one thing, ordering supplies is more difficult here. if i need a pump, a paddle wheel or an automatic feeder for my farm in thailand, i can just walk market and get it. here, its a headache to do so, he said. despite this, business has been doing well, according to dr farshad. the company, which was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in singapore, currently owns four farms internationally, including one land-based super intensive shrimp farm in singapore. dr farshad said the company has also invested s$35 million in building the first ras trout farm in the asia pacific here in lim chu kang which is scheduled to be completed by mid-2025. our (existing) farm in singapore has been very profitable because we have a different approach and a different customer portfolio, he said. we value our shrimp at a much higher price point than the rest of the market because we produce quality shrimp. in september 2024, local agri-tech startups sustenir group and nextgen farms announced that they were bought over in a us$20 million deal and merged by united arab emirates-based future food foundry, in a move the companies said aims to address urban food challenges that require economies of scale. likewise, sustenirs chief executive jack moy said that they differentiate themselves from the rest of the market by focusing on high-demand premium crops like kale and spinach using targeted technology. sustenir currently produces between 200 and 300 tonnes of produce annually, but with the merger and construction of a new fully-automated farm factory in sungei tengah underway and expected to be completed by early 2025, mr moy said the firm would be able to produce up to 1,500 tonnes annually. he added that they were targeting for their business to break-even by the end of the year. but even among those who have not quite reaped the harvest, some strongly believe that the future of food sustainability will inevitably involve tech-enabled farms. ms lim of grograce said that the consequences of climate change, water scarcity, degradation of soil and destruction of biodiversity, clearly indicate that open-field farming will not be sustainable in the long run. that is why she is a huge advocate of indoor farming. even if people say that its not practical or too expensive, we have no choice. we have to learn how to grow indoors now, because when youre in the middle of a food crisis, it will be too late. on the aquaculture side, dr eichelberger of singapore aquaculture technologies (sat) shared similar views. sat, which was established since 2012, owns floating platforms off the eastern coast of singapore that produce sea-farmed fish using closed containment tanks. it farms about 200 tonnes of fish in a year at present, but that number will soon scale up to about 750 tonnes, said dr eichelberger. like grograce, dr eichelberger said the firm is not fully out of the woods in terms of its bottom line, but added that it had managed to get an injection of funds in the past few months. though the chief executive acknowledged the difficulties in convincing potential investors, he remains steadfast in his belief that patience is required when it comes to food sustainability here. its a long-term vision the world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1
regulations,CNA,Technology,Cybersecurity,21/10/2024 15:37,1.3367679,103.6941672,Pioneer,"these days, when wide-eyed entrepreneurs in singapore approach agri-tech consultant lionel wong for help with starting their vertical vegetable farming business, his advice tends to be dont do it. not that mr wong lacks passion for the business. the co-founder of upgrown farming has been in the agriculture industry for over a decade, years before the nation touted its ambitious 30-by-30 goal of producing 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030. in that time, he has seen his fair share of startups dive inhigh-tech farming hype, only to drag themselves out of the soil with their pockets significantly lighter. without a large amount of capital, very few are able to come up with a business model that allows them to survive, mr wong believes. he told cna today (high-tech) farming is not the devil here, its just a tool and knowing how to use this tool is the responsibility of the business owner. in high-tech farming, science and technology are often integrated to replicate natural environments while optimising growth conditions, allowing farms to grow more food faster, better and with less. it has been heralded as a key pillar in growing local produce in land-scarce singapore. however, despite millions of dollars allocated to various funds, grants and research and development (r&d) programmes to grow the nations nascent agricultural industry, it does not appear to have yielded the desired tangible output. the proportion of locally grown vegetables and seafood has dropped for two consecutive years, with only hen shell egg production bucking the trend slightly. furthermore, clouds of doubt have gathered over once-promising developments in vertical farming the system of cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers. in 2022, vertivegies scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang. then local indoor farm i.f.f.i closed its mega 38,000 sqm facility in

world needs to be fed, he said. the justification for all this technology (in farming) is that you become more productive at the end of it, and we think (technology) is the key to reach these productivity gains. innovation might not be as fast as in other sectors, but you need the willingness to have a long-term approach. so that means sufficient funding when youre developing those solutions. the consensus among those in the agri- and aquaculture scene is that the high-tech systems used can generate produce in a productive manner. what is left, mr poh of artisan green said, is to research and reduce the input costs and scalability of these techniques. he cited singapores water story as an example that high-tech farming can emulate. decades ago, desalination was deemed an impossible method due to its high cost. however, after years of research and development, it has now become a viable method to produce safe drinking water, he said. in order to gain food resilience, we have to be a resilient nation to support and gather around innovative companies to steer them to success. editor's note an earlier version of this article said vertivegies had scrapped plans to construct its indoor farm in lim chu kang in 2024, but in fact the plans had been scrapped in 2022. we are sorry for the error.",1
rules,CNA,Community Behavior,Social Interactions,21/10/2024 20:34,,,,"singapore thirty-seven cyclists were fined after they were caught violating the group size rule during a recent enforcement operation. the traffic police and the land transport authority (lta) conducted the joint operation on sep 28 and oct 13. during these operations, traffic police and lta officers also engaged cyclists to raise awareness on cycling rules and guidelines, the authorities said in a news release on friday (oct 18). cyclists caught breaking the group size rule will be fined s$150 (us$114). this composition fine amount was raised with effect from jan 1, 2022, to improve road safety and applies to those who break other existing cycling rules. this includes failure to stop at red lights, cycling on expressways, and riding abreast of another cyclist along single-lane roads or within bus lanes during bus lane operational hours, said the authorities. on previous enforcement operations on jul 28 and aug 4, fines were meted out to 32 cyclists for flouting the group size rule. cyclists on singapore's roads must keep to groups of no more than five bicycles in length, which means a maximum of five cyclists if they are riding in single file or 10 cyclists if riding two abreast. cycling two abreast is allowed on roads with two or more lanes. they have to ride in single file on single-lane roads and in bus lanes during the stipulated hours. the traffic police and lta said on friday they will continue to conduct enforcement operations against errant cyclists and will not hesitate to take action against them.",1
rules,CNA,Politics,International Relations,19/10/2024 15:27,,,,"singapore ms loh pei ying, former secretarial assistant to workers' party (wp) member of parliament (mp) raeesah khan, admitted on the stand on friday (oct 18) to deleting messages and calling another wp cadre after giving evidence before the committee of privileges (cop), to tell him things beyond what she had been allowed to. ms loh was also questioned about whether she had called ms khan stupid, naive and like a lao hong biscuit. lao hong is a hokkien term that literally translates as leak air but can refer to something stale or gone soft. ms loh admitted latter two descriptions but not the first, clarifying that she meant lao hong as in how ms khan can buckle quite easily under pressure. this came out when pritam singh's lawyer, mr andre jumabhoy, continued his cross-examination of ms loh, who is the second witness for the prosecution. singh is on trial for lying in parliament in 2021 before the cop, which was convened to look inconduct of ms khan, who had lied in parliament about accompanying a rape victim to a police station. he is accused of lying cop about wanting to get ms khan to tell the truth about her false anecdote. broadly, singh's case so far is that he never told ms khan to maintain her lie, but ms khan and ms loh, her close confidante, had testified contrary to this. ms loh, who left wp in late-2022 after 11 years with the party, admitted under questioning that she had deleted messages in her phone after giving evidence before the cop in december 2021. she was the first to give evidence before the cop, and she knew that the cop was already asking for messages she might have. when mr jumabhoy asked ms loh if she had certain messages from dec 2, 2021, in her phone, she asked if she should check. deputy attorney-general ang cheng hock then told the judge he was really questioning why so much time was being spent on what happened with ms loh and her fellow cadre member yudhishthra nathan, when the case was not about whether they had given false evidence before the cop. deputy principal district judge luke tan then asked mr jumabhoy, generally speaking, if any of this was relevant. mr jumabhoy replied it seems clear, that in terms of the same witnesses that have come before your court, they have come together at least one or two days before the cop, and my suggestion is - to align their evidence, and then whilst they are giving evidence, they are texting each other about what's going on, and that we say is influencing the same position they are taking here today. and in that respect, i would say, it's relevant. he was allowed to continue, and asked ms loh if she had contacted mr nathan before and after she gave evidence before the cop in december 2021. ms loh asked to check her phone and used it to say that she had texted mr nathan just before going inbuilding and later on after that. when pressed by the judge and mr jumabhoy if she had texted mr nathan while she was in the parliament building, ms loh replied i don't have those messages in my phone. did he text you? asked mr jumabhoy. ms loh repeated that she did not have those messages in her phone, then said she did not know where those messages were. she then asked if i can elaborate on this a little, i want to be honest. after judge tan permitted her to, ms loh explained i did call (mr nathan) when i was in the parliamentary (building), after i gave my evidence, they put me in a room to have lunch, and that time, mr tan chuan-jin had given me permission to call mr nathan to inform him as a courtesy that he had to come incop to give evidence. and i believe mr nathan had texted me here and there and i may have, i can't recall, i may have removed those messages from my phone, and the reason is because i was primarily concerned about the fact that i did not inform the cop of (a crisis communications expert's) presence at the meeting on oct 23 at the wp headquarters, and i didn't want her identity to come out, so i think the text messages then were about those. if i recall correctly. mr jumabhoy smiled so, there were text messages. i guess so, yeah. but i don't have them on my phone right now, said ms loh. when you say you don't have them. you deleted them. right? asked the lawyer. ms loh agreed. she said she could not recall when she deleted them. after you finished giving evidence and you walked out, did you delete messages on your phone? i'm talking about dec 2 (2021), said mr jumabhoy. i deleted lots of things, including large (chat) groups with other volunteers, said ms loh. at that point, you already knew the cop was asking for messages you might have. and your instinct when you walked out after giving evidence was to delete messages? asked the lawyer. that wasn't my instinct, i did many other things, replied ms loh. the line of questioning revealed that all conversations within the cop were meant to be confidential, but since ms loh had asked to be given a chance to give mr nathan a heads-up about being called down to testify before the cop, she was given an exception to make a phone call only about that. asked what she had told mr nathan on the phone, ms loh said i said, 'i can't believe pritam said those things press, you have to come here and tell the truth'. those were my exact words. she acknowledged that she had gone further than what the cop had allowed her to tell mr nathan in her phone call. mr jumabhoy then repeatedly pressed ms loh on what she thought mr nathan was going to do, if not tell the truth. ms loh replied i was very emotional at this point, because when i was in the cop, i was informed by mr don wee that pritam had only told the public that he was informed of raeesah's lie after oct 3 (2021). mr don read the news report to me wrongly. and i was in extreme fear and anger that mr singh had just blatantly lied. so that was my fear. i felt it was important for mr nathan to come and verify all the events i had experienced and he had experienced with me, that is why i made that statement to mr nathan. i didn't think mr nathan was going to lie, but i was compelled by emotion at that point. so you were angry. you were working on the wrong assumption, said mr jumabhoy. so, angry, with the wrong facts, you feel the need to speak to mr nathan. i think anyone in that position would have felt the same, answered ms loh. anyone in that position would have followed the rules, countered mr jumabhoy. mr jumabhoy also charged in his line of questioning that ms loh had been conspiring with ms khan and mr nathan to align their evidence before the cop. ms loh had testified that it was above my pay grade to tell ms khan to tell the truth in parliament. it's not your pay grade to tell her to tell the truth, said mr jumabhoy. but it seems to be within your pay grade to decide what evidence goes before the cop. ms loh said in various ensuing answers that she was not ms khan's secretarial assistant anymore at that point, so she was not sure about the term pay grade. i'm going to characterise that manipulative. do you agree? ... you don't think it's manipulative to decide what evidence helps you and your friends? asked mr jumabhoy. after asking for the question to be repeated, ms loh conceded it is manipulative. ms loh had told the cop that the consensus between herself, mr nathan and singh at a meeting on oct 12, 2021, was that ms khan should tell the truth. mr jumabhoy then pointed to messages ms loh exchanged with mr nathan, saying there was no consensus between the pair as to what they wanted ms khan to do. ms loh acknowledged that there had been a disagreement between herself and mr nathan on what ms khan should do, before they went for the oct 12, 2021, meeting with singh. she said mr nathan's position had been that it would be extremely damaging wp to reveal the truth to singapore and parliament. he suggested a solution that would, unfortunately, misdirect the police query, said ms loh. when you say misdirect, that's almost a nice way of saying suggesting a solution to lie, said mr jumabhoy, smiling. yes, answered ms loh. when asked if she had been 100 per cent in wanting to have ms khan tell the truth, ms loh said i had my reservations also, because of the degree of consequences i knew the party would face. i won't say 100 per cent, but i was very close to it. she said she was 90 per cent. ms loh acknowledged under questioning that mr nathan had suggested at the meeting with singh to continue the lie. mr singh responded - 'don't even suggest covering this up with another lie'. correct? asked mr jumabhoy. that's right, said ms loh. so at this meeting, or at least when it started, the only one who thought the truth should come out, was mr singh, said the lawyer. no, i thought it too, said ms loh. at least 90 per cent, said mr jumabhoy. ms loh paused before saying sure. mr jumabhoy also asked ms loh if she was concerned, around the end of november 2021, that singh would accuse her and mr nathan of conspiring with ms khan. i was extremely concerned of that after she resigned and after i think the wp announced their decision about the disciplinary panel on that matter, yeah. and to be more specific, i was extremely concerned now that i'm recalling from the 29th of november after ms khan phoned me to say the party leaders strongly recommend she resigns, said ms loh. the court heard that ms loh and ms khan received invitations on nov 29, 2021 to testify before the cop. ms khan wanted to meet ms loh. asked if ms khan may have said she wanted to meet to align facts, ms loh said maybe. however, she did not meet ms khan as it was very late and she was already meeting mr nathan and a legislative assistant, where they discussed not how much truth but how much information should be shared. mr jumabhoy charged that ms loh had said in that meeting that she wanted to give singh one last chance to act - either change the decision of the disciplinary panel with regard to expelling ms khan or forcing her resignation, or to be forthcoming with the public. ms loh would not agree to this, saying it was not an either-or situation but that she wanted singh to find a solution. this message about giving singh one last chance to act was conveyed to singh via the legislative assistant, and ms loh acknowledged that singh's response was to tell the assistant to tell ms loh to speak the truth. earlier on monday morning, the trial briefly took on a lighter tone when mr jumabhoy was questioning ms loh about terms she had used on ms khan. he asked her if she had told the wp disciplinary panel on nov 25, 2021 that ms khan was naive and stupid. i can't remember if i used those terms, but i definitely would have said naive, said ms loh, adding it was possible she said ms khan was stupid. do you think she's self-centred? asked mr jumabhoy. yes, she answered. did you describe her as 'lao hong', asked mr jumabhoy, spelling the hokkien term out. does that mean you think she's weak and crumbles under criticism? ms loh said i wouldn't use the term 'weak', but i used that term (lao hong) because i felt she was quite susceptible to criticism, yes. but in terms of your understanding what lao hong means, is it weak? asked the lawyer. would you call a lao hong biscuit a weak biscuit? countered ms loh. it's just not a crispy biscuit. i'm told for biscuits, lao hong means stale, said mr jumabhoy after looking at his colleague mr aristotle eng. i don't think it's stale in singapore, sometimes it means soft, said ms loh. the judge interjected and asked her to clarify what she meant by lao hong. i mean that ms khan can buckle quite easily under pressure. she's susceptible to criticism ... what people say about her ... affects her ... quite easily. that's what i meant, answered ms loh. the defence completed its cross-examination of ms loh late on friday morning, with the prosecution doing a brief re-examination to clarify some of her answers. after that, mr jumabhoy requested to vacate the trial next thursday morning (oct 24) as singh wanted to attend his daughter's graduation, where she was giving a speech. the prosecution said they had some difficulty with the defence's application, saying trial dates had been given in april. the judge said he would decide nearer the date, depending on how the trial went. towards the end of the morning's hearing, judge tan also asked the prosecution to clarify one of singh's charges, asking if the prosecution was asking the court to draw an inference, because the words stated in the charge were not singh's exact words before the cop. deputy attorney-general ang cheng hock agreed that the prosecution was inviting the court to draw an inference in the sense that there was no suggestion by singh before the cop that he meant anything else, except that he wanted ms khan to clarify the untruth and admit it was untrue at some point. but at that point on aug 8 (2021), his evidence that he wanted that to happen - we say that was untrue, said mr ang. the hearing resumes on friday afternoon, with mr nathan taking the stand as the prosecution's third witness.",0

being a foreign, for-profit company - would be in line with the original social mission of income insurance. mr parekh said he agrees that income needs to be strengthened, but that it should not mean ceding control to foreigners. he suggested that the company needs a singaporean-controlled board of directors with real talent, real experience and a real vision to come up with a coherent seven-year business plan. we have accomplished that in other sectors and i see no reason why we cannot accomplish the same for our insurance business, he said. mr chee said that if the concerns of mccy can be addressed in a future deal, the government would consider it, whether it is from a foreign or local entity. the most important consideration is the outcome - that income becomes a stronger entity that is able to serve its policyholders well and fulfil its social mission effectively, he said. there were also concerns that the government was retrospectively changing the law to block the deal. as far as possible, the government should rely on existing laws when assessing deals for regulatory approval, said non-constituency mp hazel poa (psp). this provides confidence to investors here and abroad that our regulatory framework is stable. even though the bill we are debating today is tightly scoped, the fact that we are amending the law today so that a specific pending acquisition application can be blocked may be unsettling to investors. she cited existing sections of the insurance act, which she said suggest that mas already has the discretion not to approve the application. mr chee said there is currently no provision within the act that allows mas to consider the views of mccy when the insurer involved is a co-operative or is linked to one. the amendment allows the minister in charge of mas to consider the views of the minister responsible for the administration of the co-operative societies act. nmp usha chandradas also raised concerns about the enactment of legislation contemporaneously. we need to be careful that we are not inadvertently sending a message world at large that it is possible for corporate deals to be suddenly overturned by the government, for legislation to be rushed through and for carefully planned corporate negotiations to be disrupted, she said. she sought clarity on when the level of public interest is deemed significant enough for the government to intervene, as it did in the case of the income-allianz deal. i think more detailed explanations here will go some way towards assuring businesses and the general public that this is not something that singapore does regularly or on a whim, she said. in his closing speech, mr chee said the law was not being applied retrospectively as there was no formal application yet by allianz to obtain effective control and become a substantial shareholder of income. instead, the terms of the proposed transaction clearly stated it was subject to regulatory approval by mas, he said. the bill is an exception due to its urgency because the deal with allianz is under consideration by shareholders, mr chee added. he said that it is tightly scoped to co-operative insurers or those with a co-operative as a substantial shareholder. this recognises that insurance co-ops are a special category of insurers with a social mission, he said. the coordination and sharing of information between government bodies was also a concern raised by mps on wednesday. mp jamus lim (wp-sengkang) said it was troubling that there was no coordinated discussion between the two regulators, mas and mccy, about the proposed deal. he questioned if agencies within singapores civil service have become isolated extent that no joint working group was set up to exchange information for such a prominent transaction. he said it appears that there were multiple breakdowns of communication between different government agencies. this case may be a sign that singapore needs to examine how government departments exchange relevant data and information, said assoc prof lim. nmp mark lee also said mondays ministerial statement highlighted a delay in mccys involvement. perhaps earlier involvement of relevant agencies could have flagged potential deal breakers sooner, enabling businesses to address concerns early and avoid public intervention, said mr lee. in response, mr chee said there needs to be a balance between sharing information with the government and keeping commercial details confidential. information given to mas by financial institutions is confidential and normally would not be shared with government agencies. we recognise that companies submit such information for a specific regulatory purpose and not to enable general government evaluation, said mr chee. he also said that the proposal was still being assessed at the time, and the mas only saw that incomes planned capital reduction and cash remittance could be relevant to mccys views on the transaction. mr tong said after mccy reviewed the information, it decided that the deal was not in the public interest and decided to table amendments insurance act. the amendments are scoped narrowly, rather than seeking broad powers, he said. we have chosen to act in this way because we feel that's the most transparent and above-board manner, he said. it will uphold rather than diminish singapore's consistent reputation as a hub for business that is open, transparent and rules-based.",1

that income becomes a stronger entity that is able to serve its policyholders well and fulfil its social mission effectively, he said. there were also concerns that the government was retrospectively changing the law to block the deal. as far as possible, the government should rely on existing laws when assessing deals for regulatory approval, said non-constituency mp hazel poa (psp). this provides confidence to investors here and abroad that our regulatory framework is stable. even though the bill we are debating today is tightly scoped, the fact that we are amending the law today so that a specific pending acquisition application can be blocked may be unsettling to investors. she cited existing sections of the insurance act, which she said suggest that mas already has the discretion not to approve the application. mr chee said there is currently no provision within the act that allows mas to consider the views of mccy when the insurer involved is a co-operative or is linked to one. the amendment allows the minister in charge of mas to consider the views of the minister responsible for the administration of the co-operative societies act. nmp usha chandradas also raised concerns about the enactment of legislation contemporaneously. we need to be careful that we are not inadvertently sending a message world at large that it is possible for corporate deals to be suddenly overturned by the government, for legislation to be rushed through and for carefully planned corporate negotiations to be disrupted, she said. she sought clarity on when the level of public interest is deemed significant enough for the government to intervene, as it did in the case of the income-allianz deal. i think more detailed explanations here will go some way towards assuring businesses and the general public that this is not something that singapore does regularly or on a whim, she said. in his closing speech, mr chee said the law was not being applied retrospectively as there was no formal application yet by allianz to obtain effective control and become a substantial shareholder of income. instead, the terms of the proposed transaction clearly stated it was subject to regulatory approval by mas, he said. the bill is an exception due to its urgency because the deal with allianz is under consideration by shareholders, mr chee added. he said that it is tightly scoped to co-operative insurers or those with a co-operative as a substantial shareholder. this recognises that insurance co-ops are a special category of insurers with a social mission, he said. the coordination and sharing of information between government bodies was also a concern raised by mps on wednesday. mp jamus lim (wp-sengkang) said it was troubling that there was no coordinated discussion between the two regulators, mas and mccy, about the proposed deal. he questioned if agencies within singapores civil service have become isolated extent that no joint working group was set up to exchange information for such a prominent transaction. he said it appears that there were multiple breakdowns of communication between different government agencies. this case may be a sign that singapore needs to examine how government departments exchange relevant data and information, said assoc prof lim. nmp mark lee also said mondays ministerial statement highlighted a delay in mccys involvement. perhaps earlier involvement of relevant agencies could have flagged potential deal breakers sooner, enabling businesses to address concerns early and avoid public intervention, said mr lee. in response, mr chee said there needs to be a balance between sharing information with the government and keeping commercial details confidential. information given to mas by financial institutions is confidential and normally would not be shared with government agencies. we recognise that companies submit such information for a specific regulatory purpose and not to enable general government evaluation, said mr chee. he also said that the proposal was still being assessed at the time, and the mas only saw that incomes planned capital reduction and cash remittance could be relevant to mccys views on the transaction. mr tong said after mccy reviewed the information, it decided that the deal was not in the public interest and decided to table amendments insurance act. the amendments are scoped narrowly, rather than seeking broad powers, he said. we have chosen to act in this way because we feel that's the most transparent and above-board manner, he said. it will uphold rather than diminish singapore's consistent reputation as a hub for business that is open, transparent and rules-based.",1

that income becomes a stronger entity that is able to serve its policyholders well and fulfil its social mission effectively, he said. there were also concerns that the government was retrospectively changing the law to block the deal. as far as possible, the government should rely on existing laws when assessing deals for regulatory approval, said non-constituency mp hazel poa (psp). this provides confidence to investors here and abroad that our regulatory framework is stable. even though the bill we are debating today is tightly scoped, the fact that we are amending the law today so that a specific pending acquisition application can be blocked may be unsettling to investors. she cited existing sections of the insurance act, which she said suggest that mas already has the discretion not to approve the application. mr chee said there is currently no provision within the act that allows mas to consider the views of mccy when the insurer involved is a co-operative or is linked to one. the amendment allows the minister in charge of mas to consider the views of the minister responsible for the administration of the co-operative societies act. nmp usha chandradas also raised concerns about the enactment of legislation contemporaneously. we need to be careful that we are not inadvertently sending a message world at large that it is possible for corporate deals to be suddenly overturned by the government, for legislation to be rushed through and for carefully planned corporate negotiations to be disrupted, she said. she sought clarity on when the level of public interest is deemed significant enough for the government to intervene, as it did in the case of the income-allianz deal. i think more detailed explanations here will go some way towards assuring businesses and the general public that this is not something that singapore does regularly or on a whim, she said. in his closing speech, mr chee said the law was not being applied retrospectively as there was no formal application yet by allianz to obtain effective control and become a substantial shareholder of income. instead, the terms of the proposed transaction clearly stated it was subject to regulatory approval by mas, he said. the bill is an exception due to its urgency because the deal with allianz is under consideration by shareholders, mr chee added. he said that it is tightly scoped to co-operative insurers or those with a co-operative as a substantial shareholder. this recognises that insurance co-ops are a special category of insurers with a social mission, he said. the coordination and sharing of information between government bodies was also a concern raised by mps on wednesday. mp jamus lim (wp-sengkang) said it was troubling that there was no coordinated discussion between the two regulators, mas and mccy, about the proposed deal. he questioned if agencies within singapores civil service have become isolated extent that no joint working group was set up to exchange information for such a prominent transaction. he said it appears that there were multiple breakdowns of communication between different government agencies. this case may be a sign that singapore needs to examine how government departments exchange relevant data and information, said assoc prof lim. nmp mark lee also said mondays ministerial statement highlighted a delay in mccys involvement. perhaps earlier involvement of relevant agencies could have flagged potential deal breakers sooner, enabling businesses to address concerns early and avoid public intervention, said mr lee. in response, mr chee said there needs to be a balance between sharing information with the government and keeping commercial details confidential. information given to mas by financial institutions is confidential and normally would not be shared with government agencies. we recognise that companies submit such information for a specific regulatory purpose and not to enable general government evaluation, said mr chee. he also said that the proposal was still being assessed at the time, and the mas only saw that incomes planned capital reduction and cash remittance could be relevant to mccys views on the transaction. mr tong said after mccy reviewed the information, it decided that the deal was not in the public interest and decided to table amendments insurance act. the amendments are scoped narrowly, rather than seeking broad powers, he said. we have chosen to act in this way because we feel that's the most transparent and above-board manner, he said. it will uphold rather than diminish singapore's consistent reputation as a hub for business that is open, transparent and rules-based.",1

that income becomes a stronger entity that is able to serve its policyholders well and fulfil its social mission effectively, he said. there were also concerns that the government was retrospectively changing the law to block the deal. as far as possible, the government should rely on existing laws when assessing deals for regulatory approval, said non-constituency mp hazel poa (psp). this provides confidence to investors here and abroad that our regulatory framework is stable. even though the bill we are debating today is tightly scoped, the fact that we are amending the law today so that a specific pending acquisition application can be blocked may be unsettling to investors. she cited existing sections of the insurance act, which she said suggest that mas already has the discretion not to approve the application. mr chee said there is currently no provision within the act that allows mas to consider the views of mccy when the insurer involved is a co-operative or is linked to one. the amendment allows the minister in charge of mas to consider the views of the minister responsible for the administration of the co-operative societies act. nmp usha chandradas also raised concerns about the enactment of legislation contemporaneously. we need to be careful that we are not inadvertently sending a message world at large that it is possible for corporate deals to be suddenly overturned by the government, for legislation to be rushed through and for carefully planned corporate negotiations to be disrupted, she said. she sought clarity on when the level of public interest is deemed significant enough for the government to intervene, as it did in the case of the income-allianz deal. i think more detailed explanations here will go some way towards assuring businesses and the general public that this is not something that singapore does regularly or on a whim, she said. in his closing speech, mr chee said the law was not being applied retrospectively as there was no formal application yet by allianz to obtain effective control and become a substantial shareholder of income. instead, the terms of the proposed transaction clearly stated it was subject to regulatory approval by mas, he said. the bill is an exception due to its urgency because the deal with allianz is under consideration by shareholders, mr chee added. he said that it is tightly scoped to co-operative insurers or those with a co-operative as a substantial shareholder. this recognises that insurance co-ops are a special category of insurers with a social mission, he said. the coordination and sharing of information between government bodies was also a concern raised by mps on wednesday. mp jamus lim (wp-sengkang) said it was troubling that there was no coordinated discussion between the two regulators, mas and mccy, about the proposed deal. he questioned if agencies within singapores civil service have become isolated extent that no joint working group was set up to exchange information for such a prominent transaction. he said it appears that there were multiple breakdowns of communication between different government agencies. this case may be a sign that singapore needs to examine how government departments exchange relevant data and information, said assoc prof lim. nmp mark lee also said mondays ministerial statement highlighted a delay in mccys involvement. perhaps earlier involvement of relevant agencies could have flagged potential deal breakers sooner, enabling businesses to address concerns early and avoid public intervention, said mr lee. in response, mr chee said there needs to be a balance between sharing information with the government and keeping commercial details confidential. information given to mas by financial institutions is confidential and normally would not be shared with government agencies. we recognise that companies submit such information for a specific regulatory purpose and not to enable general government evaluation, said mr chee. he also said that the proposal was still being assessed at the time, and the mas only saw that incomes planned capital reduction and cash remittance could be relevant to mccys views on the transaction. mr tong said after mccy reviewed the information, it decided that the deal was not in the public interest and decided to table amendments insurance act. the amendments are scoped narrowly, rather than seeking broad powers, he said. we have chosen to act in this way because we feel that's the most transparent and above-board manner, he said. it will uphold rather than diminish singapore's consistent reputation as a hub for business that is open, transparent and rules-based.",0

rules,CNA,Environment,Urban Development,16/10/2024 20:10,1.3590288,103.7636796,Hillview,"singapore plus flats, a new category of housing and development board (hdb) flats launched for the first time, are likely to see robust demand in the latest build-to-order (bto) sales exercise, analysts said. apart from good locations near the city centre, mrt stations and amenities, these flats have been priced attractively in the bto launch that opened for applications from wednesday (oct 16). subsidy clawbacks one of the rules imposed on the new flat category are also set at modest rates of 6 to 8 per cent and will unlikely be deal breakers for aspiring home owners, analysts added. hdb on wednesday rolled out 8,573 new flats that are categorised as standard, plus and prime for the first time, doing away with the decades-old classification of mature and non-mature estates. out of the 15 bto projects, seven are under the plus category, one in prime and another seven given the standard classification based on their proximity city centre, transport connectivity and amenities. 1. a new classification system the build-to-order (bto) sales exercise, which runs from oct 16 to 23, is the first time that new flats are classified as standard, plus and prime. selling prices for the 3,273 plus flats on offer range from s$187,000 (us$142,000) for a two-room flexi unit at central trio amk to s$727,000 for a four-room unit at towner breeze. eras key executive officer eugene lim described these as very attractive prices that are set at a significant discount off the market price in the resale market. for example, prices for four-room flats at the new towner breeze in kallangwhampoa range from s$522,000 to s$727,000 without grants. by comparison, comparable four-room resale flats nearby have been sold at prices ranging from s$955,000 to s$1.2 million. some of the plus flats are also priced very close or even lower than those offered in standard projects, said huttons asias senior director of data analytics lee sze teck. take the costa riviera i and ii in pasir ris which are classified as standard flats. four-room units there are going from s$481,000 to s$595,000 excluding grants, similar prices of plus projects in ang mo kio and more than those in kembangan. four-room flats at central trio amk are priced from s$481,000 to s$603,000, while those at kembangan wave start from s$453,000 to s$592,000. this may entice some buyers to consider plus btos because for a similar price, buyers get to stay in a centrally located area, mr lee said. analysts also described the subsidy recovery rates of 6 to 8 per cent for plus flats, and 9 per cent for the sales exercises only prime project as reasonable. as plus and prime flats are priced with more subsides to ensure affordability, clawbacks are in place to maintain parity with other bto flat buyers who are not accorded additional subsidies, hdb said. a subsidy recovery rate derived as a percentage of the flats resale or valuation price, whichever is higher is also imposed on flats under the prime location public housing model. it started with 6 per cent in 2021 before being raised to 8 per cent in late 2023 and 9 per cent in june. taking that as reference, the rates for projects in the october bto launch are relatively modest and may still be palatable to prospective flat buyers, said propnex chief executive officer ismail gafoor. eras mr lim cited the example of a plus flat with an 8 per cent subsidy clawback. assuming an eventual resale price of s$1.3 million, an 8 per cent clawback is s$104,000, he said. but with the current bto price of these ... flats at s$300,000 to s$400,000 cheaper than resale flats in the vicinity, the bto purchaser is enjoying significant market price discount for a new brand flat in the same location. so, the clawback amount should not be a deal breaker. also noting that buyers are likely to respond positively plus flats, singapore realtors' head of research mohan sandrasegeran said having tiered subsidy recovery rates allow for greater diversity in housing options and will help home buyers to better select flats that are suitable for them. meanwhile, keen interest is also expected from singles who, for the first time, are allowed to apply for two-room flexi flats across singapore. previously, singles were limited to bto flats in non-mature estates. towner breeze, which offers 139 two-room flexi units, may be a hot favourite for this group of flat applicants given its proximity city centre, said ms christine sun, chief researcher and strategist at orangetee group. the october bto launch also consists of one prime project crawford heights in kallangwhampoa where 312 flats are available. prices, excluding grants, range from s$390,000 to s$523,000 for a three-room unit, and s$568,000 to s$759,000 for a four-room flat. this means a price difference of less than 10 per cent when compared with the two plus projects in the same town, said ms sun. she added that some buyers may hence see the prime flats as a better deal due potential to yield a higher price premium when they can sell their flats. crawford heights is also where a new white flat concept will be piloted, which ms sun and several analysts said will be a draw for those who prefer more flexibility in designing their homes. prices for these white flats will be reduced by s$6,000 for a three-room flat and s$8,600 for a four-room flat, respectively, to take into account the non-provision of internal partition walls and some electrical points, hdb announced on wednesday. that said, buyers have different housing needs and not all will be comfortable with the tighter restrictions in place for plus and prime flats. a longer minimum occupation period of 10 years, for one, will be a concern for some. job changes or expansion of family, or caregiving duties for elderly parents might trigger the need to shift homes. so, buyers (will be concerned) about how their housing needs may evolve overtime and choose not to be locked into a prolonged minimum occupation period, said mr lim, adding that these buyers may be drawn to conveniently located standard flats such as those in pasir ris and sengkang. echoing a similar view, ms sun said there will be buyers who do not see a huge difference in locational benefits and instead favour standard projects with shorter waiting times. given how standard flats come with the typical five-year minimum occupation period, owners can sell their flats and upgrade to another home earlier, said ms sun. for example, they may sell their flats approximately seven to eight years from application, in contrast 15 to 17-year wait for plus and prime flats, she added. the october bto launch is offering 2,085 new flats with shorter waiting times of 24 to 33 months across three projects in bukit batok and sengkang. describing this as a good strategy that will meet the needs of those who need a flat sooner, ms sun said this may also be a strategic move aimed at having a more equitable distribution of applicant interest. this way, more buyers will have a higher chance of success in their ballot, she said.",1

range from s$390,000 to s$523,000 for a three-room unit, and s$568,000 to s$759,000 for a four-room flat. this means a price difference of less than 10 per cent when compared with the two plus projects in the same town, said ms sun. she added that some buyers may hence see the prime flats as a better deal due potential to yield a higher price premium when they can sell their flats. crawford heights is also where a new white flat concept will be piloted, which ms sun and several analysts said will be a draw for those who prefer more flexibility in designing their homes. prices for these white flats will be reduced by s$6,000 for a three-room flat and s$8,600 for a four-room flat, respectively, to take into account the non-provision of internal partition walls and some electrical points, hdb announced on wednesday. that said, buyers have different housing needs and not all will be comfortable with the tighter restrictions in place for plus and prime flats. a longer minimum occupation period of 10 years, for one, will be a concern for some. job changes or expansion of family, or caregiving duties for elderly parents might trigger the need to shift homes. so, buyers (will be concerned) about how their housing needs may evolve overtime and choose not to be locked into a prolonged minimum occupation period, said mr lim, adding that these buyers may be drawn to conveniently located standard flats such as those in pasir ris and sengkang. echoing a similar view, ms sun said there will be buyers who do not see a huge difference in locational benefits and instead favour standard projects with shorter waiting times. given how standard flats come with the typical five-year minimum occupation period, owners can sell their flats and upgrade to another home earlier, said ms sun. for example, they may sell their flats approximately seven to eight years from application, in contrast 15 to 17-year wait for plus and prime flats, she added. the october bto launch is offering 2,085 new flats with shorter waiting times of 24 to 33 months across three projects in bukit batok and sengkang. describing this as a good strategy that will meet the needs of those who need a flat sooner, ms sun said this may also be a strategic move aimed at having a more equitable distribution of applicant interest. this way, more buyers will have a higher chance of success in their ballot, she said.",1

rules,CNA,Community Behavior,Social Interactions,17/10/2024 14:01,1.2966426,103.7763939,Kent Ridge,"singapore it was 2019 and singapore undergraduate christian oh was looking for part-time work to help his family, which was in financial trouble then. property agent was suggested to him. i am not someone who is very good at talking but my friend said, why don't you just give it one try? by the end of 2020, mr oh was earning five-figure sales commissions and ranked among the top 100 at his property agency. he turned full-time after graduating in 2021. that year, he was named millionaire - a title given to realtors who earn s$1 million (us$764,000) in commission a year. joining the real estate industry after graduation also meant breaking a scholarship bond a painful decision not just because of a six-figure penalty, but also because mr oh was giving up his ambition to become a teacher. but the 28-year-old now director of investments at jna real estate, a division under propnex realty has no regrets. i believe in how real estate investments can be a tool for financial and retirement planning, he told cna earlier in october. i have done it for myself and my parents, and i know i can replicate it for others. mr swan htet oo was also in university when he realised he wanted a career in real estate instead. the civil engineering student was amazed by a virtual viewing of a condominium showflat, which a property agent had customised to his family's needs. also impressed by what he saw as the industry's adaptability during the covid-19 pandemic, mr swan signed up for a real estate salesperson course in 2020, while juggling his undergraduate studies. it took four tries before he passed the notoriously difficult examination, the 28-year-old recalled with a chuckle. his experience on the job since has been more smooth sailing. two years in and mr swan is already one of huttons asias top agents, having been named a rising millionaire for earning at least s$500,000 in commission a year. mr oh and mr swan are among those who've ditched ostensibly more traditional professions to become real estate agents, and who appear to have struck gold. the industry has welcomed thousands of new entrants in recent years suggesting the growing popularity of the profession. at the same time, criticism has arisen over what some perceive as ostentatious conduct by agents, along with concerns of an oversupply. the property market has also slowed down from a pandemic-fuelled boom in 2021 and 2022. for the whole of 2023, the number of private homes sold fell to its lowest level since 2016, dampened by government cooling measures and elevated interest rates. thus far in 2024, sales figures from january to august are down 48.6 per cent over the same period last year. then there is the emergence of younger, tech-savvy buyers embracing do-it-yourself (diy) property transactions, further stirring up questions over whether the good run for the real estate agent industry is coming to an end. figures from singapore's council for estate agencies (cea) showed 35,251 property agents as at jan 1, 2024. the number of new entrants has remained relatively stable at just over 2,000 annually between 2021 and 2023, the industry regulator told cna. about 70 per cent of them were in their 30s and 40s. propnex is singapores largest property agency with 11,999 agents. era comes next with 8,891 agents, followed by huttons asia with 5,298, orangetee & tie with 2,814 and sri with 1,286 agents. at least two of these agencies have seen more young people joining their sales force. about 55 per cent of new agents who joined era last year were below 35 years old, up from 40 per cent in 2021. it was a similar number at huttons asia, where half of newcomers in 2023 were 35 and below. more people have been drawn industry by rising property prices and attractive commissions, said professor sing tien foo from the national university of singapore (nus). currently, there are no set rules for commission rates but property agents typically ask for between 1 and 4 per cent of the transaction price, depending on who they represent and the property type. at era, the average annual income of a new agent under the age of 35 and with at least one transaction was s$30,000 last year. for those who made it top 5 per cent within the agency, the figure was s$170,000. these numbers are lower than that in 2021 but things seem to be looking up, with interest rates now falling and developers lining up more new projects, said eras key executive officer eugene lim. also burnishing the property agent's appeal as a profession is how it's shed the image of a cowboy industry, after cea was set up as a regulatory body in late 2010, said mr adam wang, president of the singapore estate agents association (seaa). as part of the regulatory regime, all new property agents must take a preparatory course and pass an exam before they can be registered with cea. the exam has been described by industry players as tough, with a passing mark of 60 out of 100. as it is not easy to pass the exams and maintain the high standards to renew the licence, (the property agent) is now a much-coveted profession to a rising number of graduates, said huttons asias chief executive officer mark yip. their work has also evolved beyond just being a salesman to requiring different skills ranging from digital marketing to financial analysis, said propnex's chief agency officer eddie lim. put it all together and the work of realtor is no longer seen as a side income gig, eras mr lim added. yet, property agents have also come under fire for what some decry as flashy lifestyles being paraded online. take a video posted on era's tiktok account last year. titled asking millionaires how much is their outfit, it features an agent introducing his branded clothing and accessories, which come up to an eye-watering total of s$54,700. the clip has garnered nearly 200,000 views to date and going by the comments, not all netizens are impressed. one wondered about the purpose of the video and asked (are) we overpaying agents?, while another called it humble bragging at its finest. mr oh, the 28-year-old agent, was on the receiving end of similar criticism after revealing in an online video last year that he had amassed five properties under his name, and bought another three as gifts for his parents and wife. he said the video, produced by his team at jna real estate, was aimed at sharing his personal story and journey into property investment. i saw some of the comments in the online forums. that was tough, said mr oh, with a smile. but my personal investments have helped me to achieve my goals, which is to give my parents a better life and they can now semi-retire because of passive rental income. so i am thankful for that and i was trying to portray how real estate can be a way to better steward our wealth. he said he revealed his portfolio not to show off, but to build up personal branding. sharing his own investing experience and successes has helped build trust with his clients, mr oh added. seaas mr wang also made the point that agents may showcase achievements or lifestyles to recruit team members or attract clients. some customers prefer agents who are seen as successful. propnex told cna it has guidelines to ensure property agents represent themselves and the company with dignity and professionalism, both online and offline. era meanwhile offers internal training on social media and personal branding, and reminds agents to be mindful and sensitive with their online presence, said its key executive officer mr lim. people may be too quick to criticise at times, and narrowly focusing on the rewarding part of the job while ignoring the hard-at-work part, he added. ask any successful agent and they will tell you that while the rewards may be great, it requires discipline, resourcefulness and sound business and people management skills ... it is a tough business and not a walk in the park. mr pow ying khuan, lecturer at ngee ann polytechnics school of design and environment, said social media portrayals of an agents lifestyle are not representative of the entire industry. while some criticism, such as concerns about high commissions, may still be valid, it is also important to recognise the value that (real estate salespersons) bring table. that said, the relevance of a property agent has also come under the spotlight, with diy transactions made easier through online platforms that match sellers and buyers directly. in may, the housing and development board (hdb) rolled out a service allowing homeowners to list their flats for sale directly on hdbs online portal. prospective buyers can browse listings and transact directly with sellers. questions have been asked about whether property agents are worth their commissions - especially as these fees have become substantially heftier along with rising property prices. adding fuel debate is the emergence of flat-fee agents such as homeseller. the platform started out in 2019 and charges a flat fee of s$1,999 to buyers and sellers of hdb resale flats. according to its website, for a s$600,000 apartment, this would save clients s$10,000 otherwise given in commissions. huttons asias ceo mr yip said however that the notion of property agents earning high commission fees was a misunderstanding. the commission paid to a res (real estate salesperson) in singapore is comparable commission in malaysia and australia. the gross per capita income of a res in singapore is probably around s$70,000, he said, adding that this figure excludes operational costs, as well as yearly medisave contributions. an agents typical operational costs include personal marketing campaigns, data analytics, home staging, video production for clients homes and listings on property portals. the latter is essential for closing deals, agents said, and has been costing more as portals adjust their offerings of paid features that allow agents to boost listings. it's not unheard of for top agents to spend at least s$50,000 a year on listing fees alone. all these costs are borne entirely by agents, even if a deal doesn't pan out. clients can walk away anytime, said mr swan, who has had clients decide not to sell their homes after close to nine months of marketing. there is nothing you can do but to bear the losses. sometimes, sellers also engage multiple property agents. this sets up fierce competition among the agents, who'll have to boost listings non-stop in hopes of sealing the deal, said mr swan. property agents also stressed that being commission-based doesn't mean they should be seen as profit-motivated. mr swan said he once dissuaded a couple from investing in a property as it was not in line with their family needs and long-term goals. i can choose to close the deal, but i don't want to. for me, it's not always about commission, he said, adding that he believes in giving frank advice to clients to build long-term relationships. the number of property agents, set against singapores market size, has also raised concerns around an oversupply. about 65 per cent of senior property industry executives polled by nus last year thought so. nearly a quarter of the survey respondents felt there could be a cap on agent numbers. property agencies however pointed out to cna that not all registered agents are active. arguing that agents can be quite stretched especially during busy months, era's mr lim said the population of singapore has crossed 6 million and the number of properties has been increasing year after year ... how can we cut back on the number of agents? the agencies also rebuffed the idea of a cap, saying it could encourage agents to hold on to their licences and deter potentially more qualified new entrants. market forces will determine whether there are insufficient or too many agents in the market, orangetees chief executive officer justin quek said. mr pow from ngee ann polytechnic meanwhile noted that beyond housing, the real estate sector also covers commercial properties as well as customers looking to invest overseas. so while some of these segments may be saturated with agents, others may still require their services, he added. rather than a strict cap, raising entry standards and promoting ongoing professional development would likely be more effective. this approach ensures that (agents) entering the field are well-trained while allowing the market to remain flexible to changes in demand. nonetheless, a bigger pool of agents in a slowing property market means that competition is heating up. amid feedback from some agents about rising operating costs, orangetee will let agents receive 100 per cent of the commission from new launches with effect immediately for the next nine months. property agencies typically take a cut from their agents' commissions. agencies have also been chipping in on the technological front. propnex, for one, offers in-house marketing and digital platforms to help its agents reach clients more efficiently, minimising unnecessary expenditures. from october next year, cea will require property agents to clock 16 hours of training a year, up from six to nine hours currently, to renew their licences. nus professor sing said this would help further professionalise the industry, but he also suggested that stricter regulations might help eradicate unethical practices such as misleading listings with unrealistic asking prices. seaa, on its end, has partnered property agencies and listing portals to develop a prototype aiming to tackle fake listings. after two years of work, the prototype has been handed over to cea. if this is put in place, agents will have to go through this platform to get their listings checked and verified before the listings can be posted on any property portals, said the association's president mr wang. in response to queries including on initiatives to raise standards, cea said property agents are expected to uphold high standards of professionalism and ethical conduct when carrying out their work ... we will continue to work closely with the industry to enhance professional and ethical standards amongst property agencies and agents to ensure that consumers interests are protected. industry players told cna that the fundamental value of a property agent now goes beyond just connecting buyers and sellers. they need to act as consultants, guiding their clients through market trends, analysing pros and cons, and ultimately helping them make informed decisions, said propnex's mr lim. this is especially the case for more complex or emotional transactions, such as helping a grieving family to sell a flat belonging to a deceased family member. in such a situation, agents can help navigate the necessary steps during this difficult period and even, at times, act as a bridge to discuss the sale sensitively with other family members, said mr wang. this was why mr aaron koh took the plunge to become a property agent after 16 years as a teacher. the 44-year-old first got interested in real estate about two years ago, after selling his first home in a process he described as emotional, physical and financial. he had great help then from a property agent who handled both the sale and the search for a new place. he arranged for viewings, helped me with the legwork and especially the timeline between selling my old place and getting my new home ready, recalled mr koh. in the process, my wife got pregnant so we decided to delay the moving and my agent helped to re-negotiate the timeline. these are all things that i would not have done on my own. the experience prompted a career switch and since joining huttons asia a month ago, mr koh has been undergoing training and working the ground at roadshows and new launches as well as by knocking on doors. i want to make this work as a long-term career, he said. i definitely hope to see success, but i will be patient. right now, its about levelling up my knowledge and making sure people can trust me.",1
rules,CNA,Community Behavior,Social Interactions,17/10/2024 14:01,1.3330863,103.7759366,King Albert Park,"singapore it was 2019 and singapore undergraduate christian oh was looking for part-time work to help his family, which was in financial trouble then. property agent was suggested to him. i am not someone who is very good at talking but my friend said, why don't you just give it one try? by the end of 2020, mr oh was earning five-figure sales commissions and ranked among the top 100 at his property agency. he turned full-time after graduating in 2021. that year, he was named millionaire - a title given to realtors who earn s$1 million (us$764,000) in commission a year. joining the real estate industry after graduation also meant breaking a scholarship bond a painful decision not just because of a six-figure penalty, but also because mr oh was giving up his ambition to become a teacher. but the 28-year-old now director of investments at jna real estate, a division under propnex realty has no regrets. i believe in how real estate investments can be a tool for financial and retirement planning, he told cna earlier in october. i have done it for myself and my parents, and i know i can replicate it for others. mr swan htet oo was also in university when he realised he wanted a career in real estate instead. the civil engineering student was amazed by a virtual viewing of a condominium showflat, which a property agent had customised to his family's needs. also impressed by what he saw as the industry's adaptability during the covid-19 pandemic, mr swan signed up for a real estate salesperson course in 2020, while juggling his undergraduate studies. it took four tries before he passed the notoriously difficult examination, the 28-year-old recalled with a chuckle. his experience on the job since has been more smooth sailing. two years in and mr swan is already one of huttons asias top agents, having been named a rising millionaire for earning at least s$500,000 in commission a year. mr oh and mr swan are among those who've ditched ostensibly more traditional professions to become real estate agents, and who appear to have struck gold. the industry has welcomed thousands of new entrants in recent years suggesting the growing popularity of the profession. at the same time, criticism has arisen over what some perceive as ostentatious conduct by agents, along with concerns of an oversupply. the property market has also slowed down from a pandemic-fuelled boom in 2021 and 2022. for the whole of 2023, the number of private homes sold fell to its lowest level since 2016, dampened by government cooling measures and elevated interest rates. thus far in 2024, sales figures from january to august are down 48.6 per cent over the same period last year. then there is the emergence of younger, tech-savvy buyers embracing do-it-yourself (diy) property transactions, further stirring up questions over whether the good run for the real estate agent industry is coming to an end. figures from singapore's council for estate agencies (cea) showed 35,251 property agents as at jan 1, 2024. the number of new entrants has remained relatively stable at just over 2,000 annually between 2021 and 2023, the industry regulator told cna. about 70 per cent of them were in their 30s and 40s. propnex is singapores largest property agency with 11,999 agents. era comes next with 8,891 agents, followed by huttons asia with 5,298, orangetee & tie with 2,814 and sri with 1,286 agents. at least two of these agencies have seen more young people joining their sales force. about 55 per cent of new agents who joined era last year were below 35 years old, up from 40 per cent in 2021. it was a similar number at huttons asia, where half of newcomers in 2023 were 35 and below. more people have been drawn industry by rising property prices and attractive commissions, said professor sing tien foo from the national university of singapore (nus). currently, there are no set rules for commission rates but property agents typically ask for between 1 and 4 per cent of the transaction price, depending on who they represent and the property type. at era, the average annual income of a new agent under the age of 35 and with at least one transaction was s$30,000 last year. for those who made it top 5 per cent within the agency, the figure was s$170,000. these numbers are lower than that in 2021 but things seem to be looking up, with interest rates now falling and developers lining up more new projects, said eras key executive officer eugene lim. also burnishing the property agent's appeal as a profession is how it's shed the image of a cowboy industry, after cea was set up as a regulatory body in late 2010, said mr adam wang, president of the singapore estate agents association (seaa). as part of the regulatory regime, all new property agents must take a preparatory course and pass an exam before they can be registered with cea. the exam has been described by industry players as tough, with a passing mark of 60 out of 100. as it is not easy to pass the exams and maintain the high standards to renew the licence, (the property agent) is now a much-coveted profession to a rising number of graduates, said huttons asias chief executive officer mark yip. their work has also evolved beyond just being a salesman to requiring different skills ranging from digital marketing to financial analysis, said propnex's chief agency officer eddie lim. put it all together and the work of realtor is no longer seen as a side income gig, eras mr lim added. yet, property agents have also come under fire for what some decry as flashy lifestyles being paraded online. take a video posted on era's tiktok account last year. titled asking millionaires how much is their outfit, it features an agent introducing his branded clothing and accessories, which come up to an eye-watering total of s$54,700. the clip has garnered nearly 200,000 views to date and going by the comments, not all netizens are impressed. one wondered about the purpose of the video and asked (are) we overpaying agents?, while another called it humble bragging at its finest. mr oh, the 28-year-old agent, was on the receiving end of similar criticism after revealing in an online video last year that he had amassed five properties under his name, and bought another three as gifts for his parents and wife. he said the video, produced by his team at jna real estate, was aimed at sharing his personal story and journey into property investment. i saw some of the comments in the online forums. that was tough, said mr oh, with a smile. but my personal investments have helped me to achieve my goals, which is to give my parents a better life and they can now semi-retire because of passive rental income. so i am thankful for that and i was trying to portray how real estate can be a way to better steward our wealth. he said he revealed his portfolio not to show off, but to build up personal branding. sharing his own investing experience and successes has helped build trust with his clients, mr oh added. seaas mr wang also made the point that agents may showcase achievements or lifestyles to recruit team members or attract clients. some customers prefer agents who are seen as successful. propnex told cna it has guidelines to ensure property agents represent themselves and the company with dignity and professionalism, both online and offline. era meanwhile offers internal training on social media and personal branding, and reminds agents to be mindful and sensitive with their online presence, said its key executive officer mr lim. people may be too quick to criticise at times, and narrowly focusing on the rewarding part of the job while ignoring the hard-at-work part, he added. ask any successful agent and they will tell you that while the rewards may be great, it requires discipline, resourcefulness and sound business and people management skills ... it is a tough business and not a walk in the park. mr pow ying khuan, lecturer at ngee ann polytechnics school of design and environment, said social media portrayals of an agents lifestyle are not representative of the entire industry. while some criticism, such as concerns about high commissions, may still be valid, it is also important to recognise the value that (real estate salespersons) bring table. that said, the relevance of a property agent has also come under the spotlight, with diy transactions made easier through online platforms that match sellers and buyers directly. in may, the housing and development board (hdb) rolled out a service allowing homeowners to list their flats for sale directly on hdbs online portal. prospective buyers can browse listings and transact directly with sellers. questions have been asked about whether property agents are worth their commissions - especially as these fees have become

practices such as misleading listings with unrealistic asking prices. seaa, on its end, has partnered property agencies and listing portals to develop a prototype aiming to tackle fake listings. after two years of work, the prototype has been handed over to cea. if this is put in place, agents will have to go through this platform to get their listings checked and verified before the listings can be posted on any property portals, said the association's president mr wang. in response to queries including on initiatives to raise standards, cea said property agents are expected to uphold high standards of professionalism and ethical conduct when carrying out their work ... we will continue to work closely with the industry to enhance professional and ethical standards amongst property agencies and agents to ensure that consumers interests are protected. industry players told cna that the fundamental value of a property agent now goes beyond just connecting buyers and sellers. they need to act as consultants, guiding their clients through market trends, analysing pros and cons, and ultimately helping them make informed decisions, said propnex's mr lim. this is especially the case for more complex or emotional transactions, such as helping a grieving family to sell a flat belonging to a deceased family member. in such a situation, agents can help navigate the necessary steps during this difficult period and even, at times, act as a bridge to discuss the sale sensitively with other family members, said mr wang. this was why mr aaron koh took the plunge to become a property agent after 16 years as a teacher. the 44-year-old first got interested in real estate about two years ago, after selling his first home in a process he described as emotional, physical and financial. he had great help then from a property agent who handled both the sale and the search for a new place. he arranged for viewings, helped me with the legwork and especially the timeline between selling my old place and getting my new home ready, recalled mr koh. in the process, my wife got pregnant so we decided to delay the moving and my agent helped to re-negotiate the timeline. these are all things that i would not have done on my own. the experience prompted a career switch and since joining huttons asia a month ago, mr koh has been undergoing training and working the ground at roadshows and new launches as well as by knocking on doors. i want to make this work as a long-term career, he said. i definitely hope to see success, but i will be patient. right now, its about levelling up my knowledge and making sure people can trust me.",1
rules,CNA,Community Behavior,Social Interactions,17/10/2024 14:01,1.3330863,103.7759366,King Albert Park,"singapore it was 2019 and singapore undergraduate christian oh was looking for part-time work to help his family, which was in financial trouble then. property agent was suggested to him. i am not someone who is very good at talking but my friend said, why don't you just give it one try? by the end of 2020, mr oh was earning five-figure sales commissions and ranked among the top 100 at his property agency. he turned full-time after graduating in 2021. that year, he was named millionaire - a title given to realtors who earn s$1 million (us$764,000) in commission a year. joining the real estate industry after graduation also meant breaking a scholarship bond a painful decision not just because of a six-figure penalty, but also because mr oh was giving up his ambition to become a teacher. but the 28-year-old now director of investments at jna real estate, a division under propnex realty has no regrets. i believe in how real estate investments can be a tool for financial and retirement planning, he told cna earlier in october. i have done it for myself and my parents, and i know i can replicate it for others. mr swan htet oo was also in university when he realised he wanted a career in real estate instead. the civil engineering student was amazed by a virtual viewing of a condominium showflat, which a property agent had customised to his family's needs. also impressed by what he saw as the industry's adaptability during the covid-19 pandemic, mr swan signed up for a real estate salesperson course in 2020, while juggling his undergraduate studies. it took four tries before he passed the notoriously difficult examination, the 28-year-old recalled with a chuckle. his experience on the job since has been more smooth sailing. two years in and mr swan is already one of huttons asias top agents, having been named a rising millionaire for earning at least s$500,000 in commission a year. mr oh and mr swan are among those who've ditched ostensibly more traditional professions to become real estate agents, and who appear to have struck gold. the industry has welcomed thousands of new entrants in recent years suggesting the growing popularity of the profession. at the same time, criticism has arisen over what some perceive as ostentatious conduct by agents, along with concerns of an oversupply. the property market has also slowed down from a pandemic-fuelled boom in 2021 and 2022. for the whole of 2023, the number of private homes sold fell to its lowest level since 2016, dampened by government cooling measures and elevated interest rates. thus far in 2024, sales figures from january to august are down 48.6 per cent over the same period last year. then there is the emergence of younger, tech-savvy buyers embracing do-it-yourself (diy) property transactions, further stirring up questions over whether the good run for the real estate agent industry is coming to an end. figures from singapore's council for estate agencies (cea) showed 35,251 property agents as at jan 1, 2024. the number of new entrants has remained relatively stable at just over 2,000 annually between 2021 and 2023, the industry regulator told cna. about 70 per cent of them were in their 30s and 40s. propnex is singapores largest property agency with 11,999 agents. era comes next with 8,891 agents, followed by huttons asia with 5,298, orangetee & tie with 2,814 and sri with 1,286 agents. at least two of these agencies have seen more young people joining their sales force. about 55 per cent of new agents who joined era last year were below 35 years old, up from 40 per cent in 2021. it was a similar number at huttons asia, where half of newcomers in 2023 were 35 and below. more people have been drawn industry by rising property prices and attractive commissions, said professor sing tien foo from the national university of singapore (nus). currently, there are no set rules for commission rates but property agents typically ask for between 1 and 4 per cent of the transaction price, depending on who they represent and the property type. at era, the average annual income of a new agent under the age of 35 and with at least one transaction was s$30,000 last year. for those who made it top 5 per cent within the agency, the figure was s$170,000. these numbers are lower than that in 2021 but things seem to be looking up, with interest rates now falling and developers lining up more new projects, said eras key executive officer eugene lim. also burnishing the property agent's appeal as a profession is how it's shed the image of a cowboy industry, after cea was set up as a regulatory body in late 2010, said mr adam wang, president of the singapore estate agents association (seaa). as part of the regulatory regime, all new property agents must take a preparatory course and pass an exam before they can be registered with cea. the exam has been described by industry players as tough, with a passing mark of 60 out of 100. as it is not easy to pass the exams and maintain the high standards to renew the licence, (the property agent) is now a much-coveted profession to a rising number of graduates, said huttons asias chief executive officer mark yip. their work has also evolved beyond just being a salesman to requiring different skills ranging from digital marketing to financial analysis, said propnex's chief agency officer eddie lim. put it all together and the work of realtor is no longer seen as a side income gig, eras mr lim added. yet, property agents have also come under fire for what some decry as flashy lifestyles being paraded online. take a video posted on era's tiktok account last year. titled asking millionaires how much is their outfit, it features an agent introducing his branded clothing and accessories, which come up to an eye-watering total of s$54,700. the clip has garnered nearly 200,000 views to date and going by the comments, not all netizens are impressed. one wondered about the purpose of the video and asked (are) we overpaying agents?, while another called it humble bragging at its finest. mr oh, the 28-year-old agent, was on the receiving end of similar criticism after revealing in an online video last year that he had amassed five properties under his name, and bought another three as gifts for his parents and wife. he said the video, produced by his team at jna real estate, was aimed at sharing his personal story and journey into property investment. i saw some of the comments in the online forums. that was tough, said mr oh, with a smile. but my personal investments have helped me to achieve my goals, which is to give my parents a better life and they can now semi-retire because of passive rental income. so i am thankful for that and i was trying to portray how real estate can be a way to better steward our wealth. he said he revealed his portfolio not to show off, but to build up personal branding. sharing his own investing experience and successes has helped build trust with his clients, mr oh added. seaas mr wang also made the point that agents may showcase achievements or lifestyles to recruit team members or attract clients. some customers prefer agents who are seen as successful. propnex told cna it has guidelines to ensure property agents represent themselves and the company with dignity and professionalism, both online and offline. era meanwhile offers internal training on social media and personal branding, and reminds agents to be mindful and sensitive with their online presence, said its key executive officer mr lim. people may be too quick to criticise at times, and narrowly focusing on the rewarding part of the job while ignoring the hard-at-work part, he added. ask any successful agent and they will tell you that while the rewards may be great, it requires discipline, resourcefulness and sound business and people management skills ... it is a tough business and not a walk in the park. mr pow ying khuan, lecturer at ngee ann polytechnics school of design and environment, said social media portrayals of an agents lifestyle are not representative of the entire industry. while some criticism, such as concerns about high commissions, may still be valid, it is also important to recognise the value that (real estate salespersons) bring table. that said, the relevance of a property agent has also come under the spotlight, with diy transactions made easier through online platforms that match sellers and buyers directly. in may, the housing and development board (hdb) rolled out a service allowing homeowners to list their flats for sale directly on hdbs online portal. prospective buyers can browse listings and transact directly with sellers. questions have been asked about whether property agents are worth their commissions - especially as these fees have become substantially heftier along with rising property prices. adding fuel debate is the emergence of flat-fee agents such as homeseller. the platform started out in 2019 and charges a flat fee of s$1,999 to buyers and sellers of hdb resale flats. according to its website, for a s$600,000 apartment, this would save clients s$10,000 otherwise given in commissions. huttons asias ceo mr yip said however that the notion of property agents earning high commission fees was a misunderstanding. the commission paid to a res (real estate salesperson) in singapore is comparable commission in malaysia and australia. the gross per capita income of a res in singapore is probably around s$70,000, he said, adding that this figure excludes operational costs, as well as yearly medisave contributions. an agents typical operational costs include personal marketing campaigns, data analytics, home staging, video production for clients homes and listings on property portals. the latter is essential for closing deals, agents said, and has been costing more as portals adjust their offerings of paid features that allow agents to boost listings. it's not unheard of for top agents to spend at least s$50,000 a year on listing fees alone. all these costs are borne entirely by agents, even if a deal doesn't pan out. clients can walk away anytime, said mr swan, who has had clients decide not to sell their homes after close to nine months of marketing. there is nothing you can do but to bear the losses. sometimes, sellers also engage multiple property agents. this sets up fierce competition among the agents, who'll have to boost listings non-stop in hopes of sealing the deal, said mr swan. property agents also stressed that being commission-based doesn't mean they should be seen as profit-motivated. mr swan said he once dissuaded a couple from investing in a property as it was not in line with their family needs and long-term goals. i can choose to close the deal, but i don't want to. for me, it's not always about commission, he said, adding that he believes in giving frank advice to clients to build long-term relationships. the number of property agents, set against singapores market size, has also raised concerns around an oversupply. about 65 per cent of senior property industry executives polled by nus last year thought so. nearly a quarter of the survey respondents felt there could be a cap on agent numbers. property agencies however pointed out to cna that not all registered agents are active. arguing that agents can be quite stretched especially during busy months, era's mr lim said the population of singapore has crossed 6 million and the number of properties has been increasing year after year ... how can we cut back on the number of agents? the agencies also rebuffed the idea of a cap, saying it could encourage agents to hold on to their licences and deter potentially more qualified new entrants. market forces will determine whether there are insufficient or too many agents in the market, orangetees chief executive officer justin quek said. mr pow from ngee ann polytechnic meanwhile noted that beyond housing, the real estate sector also covers commercial properties as well as customers looking to invest overseas. so while some of these segments may be saturated with agents, others may still require their services, he added. rather than a strict cap, raising entry standards and promoting ongoing professional development would likely be more effective. this approach ensures that (agents) entering the field are well-trained while allowing the market to remain flexible to changes in demand. nonetheless, a bigger pool of agents in a slowing property market means that competition is heating up. amid feedback from some agents about rising operating costs, orangetee will let agents receive 100 per cent of the commission from new launches with effect immediately for the next nine months. property agencies typically take a cut from their agents' commissions. agencies have also been chipping in on the technological front. propnex, for one, offers in-house marketing and digital platforms to help its agents reach clients more efficiently, minimising unnecessary expenditures. from october next year, cea will require property agents to clock 16 hours of training a year, up from six to nine hours currently, to renew their licences. nus professor sing said this would help further professionalise the industry, but he also suggested that stricter regulations might help eradicate unethical

virtual viewing of a condominium showflat, which a property agent had customised to his family's needs. also impressed by what he saw as the industry's adaptability during the covid-19 pandemic, mr swan signed up for a real estate salesperson course in 2020, while juggling his undergraduate studies. it took four tries before he passed the notoriously difficult examination, the 28-year-old recalled with a chuckle. his experience on the job since has been more smooth sailing. two years in and mr swan is already one of huttons asias top agents, having been named a rising millionaire for earning at least s$500,000 in commission a year. mr oh and mr swan are among those who've ditched ostensibly more traditional professions to become real estate agents, and who appear to have struck gold. the industry has welcomed thousands of new entrants in recent years suggesting the growing popularity of the profession. at the same time, criticism has arisen over what some perceive as ostentatious conduct by agents, along with concerns of an oversupply. the property market has also slowed down from a pandemic-fuelled boom in 2021 and 2022. for the whole of 2023, the number of private homes sold fell to its lowest level since 2016, dampened by government cooling measures and elevated interest rates. thus far in 2024, sales figures from january to august are down 48.6 per cent over the same period last year. then there is the emergence of younger, tech-savvy buyers embracing do-it-yourself (diy) property transactions, further stirring up questions over whether the good run for the real estate agent industry is coming to an end. figures from singapore's council for estate agencies (cea) showed 35,251 property agents as at jan 1, 2024. the number of new entrants has remained relatively stable at just over 2,000 annually between 2021 and 2023, the industry regulator told cna. about 70 per cent of them were in their 30s and 40s. propnex is singapores largest property agency with 11,999 agents. era comes next with 8,891 agents, followed by huttons asia with 5,298, orangetee & tie with 2,814 and sri with 1,286 agents. at least two of these agencies have seen more young people joining their sales force. about 55 per cent of new agents who joined era last year were below 35 years old, up from 40 per cent in 2021. it was a similar number at huttons asia, where half of newcomers in 2023 were 35 and below. more people have been drawn industry by rising property prices and attractive commissions, said professor sing tien foo from the national university of singapore (nus). currently, there are no set rules for commission rates but property agents typically ask for between 1 and 4 per cent of the transaction price, depending on who they represent and the property type. at era, the average annual income of a new agent under the age of 35 and with at least one transaction was s$30,000 last year. for those who made it top 5 per cent within the agency, the figure was s$170,000. these numbers are lower than that in 2021 but things seem to be looking up, with interest rates now falling and developers lining up more new projects, said eras key executive officer eugene lim. also burnishing the property agent's appeal as a profession is how it's shed the image of a cowboy industry, after cea was set up as a regulatory body in late 2010, said mr adam wang, president of the singapore estate agents association (seaa). as part of the regulatory regime, all new property agents must take a preparatory course and pass an exam before they can be registered with cea. the exam has been described by industry players as tough, with a passing mark of 60 out of 100. as it is not easy to pass the exams and maintain the high standards to renew the licence, (the property agent) is now a much-coveted profession to a rising number of graduates, said huttons asias chief executive officer mark yip. their work has also evolved beyond just being a salesman to requiring different skills ranging from digital marketing to financial analysis, said propnex's chief agency officer eddie lim. put it all together and the work of realtor is no longer seen as a side income gig, eras mr lim added. yet, property agents have also come under fire for what some decry as flashy lifestyles being paraded online. take a video posted on era's tiktok account last year. titled asking millionaires how much is their outfit, it features an agent introducing his branded clothing and accessories, which come up to an eye-watering total of s$54,700. the clip has garnered nearly 200,000 views to date and going by the comments, not all netizens are impressed. one wondered about the purpose of the video and asked (are) we overpaying agents?, while another called it humble bragging at its finest. mr oh, the 28-year-old agent, was on the receiving end of similar criticism after revealing in an online video last year that he had amassed five properties under his name, and bought another three as gifts for his parents and wife. he said the video, produced by his team at jna real estate, was aimed at sharing his personal story and journey into property investment. i saw some of the comments in the online forums. that was tough, said mr oh, with a smile. but my personal investments have helped me to achieve my goals, which is to give my parents a better life and they can now semi-retire because of passive rental income. so i am thankful for that and i was trying to portray how real estate can be a way to better steward our wealth. he said he revealed his portfolio not to show off, but to build up personal branding. sharing his own investing experience and successes has helped build trust with his clients, mr oh added. seaas mr wang also made the point that agents may showcase achievements or lifestyles to recruit team members or attract clients. some customers prefer agents who are seen as successful. propnex told cna it has guidelines to ensure property agents represent themselves and the company with dignity and professionalism, both online and offline. era meanwhile offers internal training on social media and personal branding, and reminds agents to be mindful and sensitive with their online presence, said its key executive officer mr lim. people may be too quick to criticise at times, and narrowly focusing on the rewarding part of the job while ignoring the hard-at-work part, he added. ask any successful agent and they will tell you that while the rewards may be great, it requires discipline, resourcefulness and sound business and people management skills ... it is a tough business and not a walk in the park. mr pow ying khuan, lecturer at ngee ann polytechnics school of design and environment, said social media portrayals of an agents lifestyle are not representative of the entire industry. while some criticism, such as concerns about high commissions, may still be valid, it is also important to recognise the value that (real estate salespersons) bring table. that said, the relevance of a property agent has also come under the spotlight, with diy transactions made easier through online platforms that match sellers and buyers directly. in may, the housing and development board (hdb) rolled out a service allowing homeowners to list their flats for sale directly on hdbs online portal. prospective buyers can browse listings and transact directly with sellers. questions have been asked about whether property agents are worth their commissions - especially as these fees have become substantially heftier along with rising property prices. adding fuel debate is the emergence of flat-fee agents such as homeseller. the platform started out in 2019 and charges a flat fee of s$1,999 to buyers and sellers of hdb resale flats. according to its website, for a s$600,000 apartment, this would save clients s$10,000 otherwise given in commissions. huttons asias ceo mr yip said however that the notion of property agents earning high commission fees was a misunderstanding. the commission paid to a res (real estate salesperson) in singapore is comparable commission in malaysia and australia. the gross per capita income of a res in singapore is probably around s$70,000, he said, adding that this figure excludes operational costs, as well as yearly medisave contributions. an agents typical operational costs include personal marketing campaigns, data analytics, home staging, video production for clients homes and listings on property portals. the latter is essential for closing deals, agents said, and has been costing more as portals adjust their offerings of paid features that allow agents to boost listings. it's not unheard of for top agents to spend at least s$50,000 a year on listing fees alone. all these costs are borne entirely by agents, even if a deal doesn't pan out. clients can walk away anytime, said mr swan, who has had clients decide not to sell their homes after close to nine months of marketing. there is nothing you can do but to bear the losses. sometimes, sellers also engage multiple property agents. this sets up fierce competition among the agents, who'll have to boost listings non-stop in hopes of sealing the deal, said mr swan. property agents also stressed that being commission-based doesn't mean they should be seen as profit-motivated. mr swan said he once dissuaded a couple from investing in a property as it was not in line with their family needs and long-term goals. i can choose to close the deal, but i don't want to. for me, it's not always about commission, he said, adding that he believes in giving frank advice to clients to build long-term relationships. the number of property agents, set against singapores market size, has also raised concerns around an oversupply. about 65 per cent of senior property industry executives polled by nus last year thought so. nearly a quarter of the survey respondents felt there could be a cap on agent numbers. property agencies however pointed out to cna that not all registered agents are active. arguing that agents can be quite stretched especially during busy months, era's mr lim said the population of singapore has crossed 6 million and the number of properties has been increasing year after year ... how can we cut back on the number of agents? the agencies also rebuffed the idea of a cap, saying it could encourage agents to hold on to their licences and deter potentially more qualified new entrants. market forces will determine whether there are insufficient or too many agents in the market, orangetees chief executive officer justin quek said. mr pow from ngee ann polytechnic meanwhile noted that beyond housing, the real estate sector also covers commercial properties as well as customers looking to invest overseas. so while some of these segments may be saturated with agents, others may still require their services, he added. rather than a strict cap, raising entry standards and promoting ongoing professional development would likely be more effective. this approach ensures that (agents) entering the field are well-trained while allowing the market to remain flexible to changes in demand. nonetheless, a bigger pool of agents in a slowing property market means that competition is heating up. amid feedback from some agents about rising operating costs, orangetee will let agents receive 100 per cent of the commission from new launches with effect immediately for the next nine months. property agencies typically take a cut from their agents' commissions. agencies have also been chipping in on the technological front. propnex, for one, offers in-house marketing and digital platforms to help its agents reach clients more efficiently, minimising unnecessary expenditures. from october next year, cea will require property agents to clock 16 hours of training a year, up from six to nine hours currently, to renew their licences. nus professor sing said this would help further professionalise the industry, but he also suggested that stricter regulations might help eradicate unethical practices such as misleading listings with unrealistic asking prices. seaa, on its end, has partnered property agencies and listing portals to develop a prototype aiming to tackle fake listings. after two years of work, the prototype has been handed over to cea. if this is put in place, agents will have to go through this platform to get their listings checked and verified before the listings can be posted on any property portals, said the association's president mr wang. in response to queries including on initiatives to raise standards, cea said property agents are expected to uphold high standards of professionalism and ethical conduct when carrying out their work ... we will continue to work closely with the industry to enhance professional and ethical standards amongst property agencies and agents to ensure that consumers interests are protected. industry players told cna that the fundamental value of a property agent now goes beyond just connecting buyers and sellers. they need to act as consultants, guiding their clients through market trends, analysing pros and cons, and ultimately helping them make informed decisions, said propnex's mr lim. this is especially the case for more complex or emotional transactions, such as helping a grieving family to sell a flat belonging to a deceased family member. in such a situation, agents can help navigate the necessary steps during this difficult period and even, at times, act as a bridge to discuss the sale sensitively with other family members, said mr wang. this was why mr aaron koh took the plunge to become a property agent after 16 years as a teacher. the 44-year-old first got interested in real estate about two years ago, after selling his first home in a process he described as emotional, physical and financial. he had great help then from a property agent who handled both the sale and the search for a new place. he arranged for viewings, helped me with the legwork and especially the timeline between selling my old place and getting my new home ready, recalled mr koh. in the process, my wife got pregnant so we decided to delay the moving and my agent helped to re-negotiate the timeline. these are all things that i would not have done on my own. the experience prompted a career switch and since joining huttons asia a month ago, mr koh has been undergoing training and working the ground at roadshows and new launches as well as by knocking on doors. i want to make this work as a long-term career, he said. i definitely hope to see success, but i will be patient. right now, its about levelling up my knowledge and making sure people can trust me.",1

before they can be registered with cea. the exam has been described by industry players as tough, with a passing mark of 60 out of 100. as it is not easy to pass the exams and maintain the high standards to renew the licence, (the property agent) is now a much-coveted profession to a rising number of graduates, said huttons asias chief executive officer mark yip. their work has also evolved beyond just being a salesman to requiring different skills ranging from digital marketing to financial analysis, said propnex's chief agency officer eddie lim. put it all together and the work of realtor is no longer seen as a side income gig, eras mr lim added. yet, property agents have also come under fire for what some decry as flashy lifestyles being paraded online. take a video posted on era's tiktok account last year. titled asking millionaires how much is their outfit, it features an agent introducing his branded clothing and accessories, which come up to an eye-watering total of s$54,700. the clip has garnered nearly 200,000 views to date and going by the comments, not all netizens are impressed. one wondered about the purpose of the video and asked (are) we overpaying agents?, while another called it humble bragging at its finest. mr oh, the 28-year-old agent, was on the receiving end of similar criticism after revealing in an online video last year that he had amassed five properties under his name, and bought another three as gifts for his parents and wife. he said the video, produced by his team at jna real estate, was aimed at sharing his personal story and journey into property investment. i saw some of the comments in the online forums. that was tough, said mr oh, with a smile. but my personal investments have helped me to achieve my goals, which is to give my parents a better life and they can now semi-retire because of passive rental income. so i am thankful for that and i was trying to portray how real estate can be a way to better steward our wealth. he said he revealed his portfolio not to show off, but to build up personal branding. sharing his own investing experience and successes has helped build trust with his clients, mr oh added. seaas mr wang also made the point that agents may showcase achievements or lifestyles to recruit team members or attract clients. some customers prefer agents who are seen as successful. propnex told cna it has guidelines to ensure property agents represent themselves and the company with dignity and professionalism, both online and offline. era meanwhile offers internal training on social media and personal branding, and reminds agents to be mindful and sensitive with their online presence, said its key executive officer mr lim. people may be too quick to criticise at times, and narrowly focusing on the rewarding part of the job while ignoring the hard-at-work part, he added. ask any successful agent and they will tell you that while the rewards may be great, it requires discipline, resourcefulness and sound business and people management skills ... it is a tough business and not a walk in the park. mr pow ying khuan, lecturer at ngee ann polytechnics school of design and environment, said social media portrayals of an agents lifestyle are not representative of the entire industry. while some criticism, such as concerns about high commissions, may still be valid, it is also important to recognise the value that (real estate salespersons) bring table. that said, the relevance of a property agent has also come under the spotlight, with diy transactions made easier through online platforms that match sellers and buyers directly. in may, the housing and development board (hdb) rolled out a service allowing homeowners to list their flats for sale directly on hdbs online portal. prospective buyers can browse listings and transact directly with sellers. questions have been asked about whether property agents are worth their commissions - especially as these fees have become substantially heftier along with rising property prices. adding fuel debate is the emergence of flat-fee agents such as homeseller. the platform started out in 2019 and charges a flat fee of s$1,999 to buyers and sellers of hdb resale flats. according to its website, for a s$600,000 apartment, this would save clients s$10,000 otherwise given in commissions. huttons asias ceo mr yip said however that the notion of property agents earning high commission fees was a misunderstanding. the commission paid to a res (real estate salesperson) in singapore is comparable commission in malaysia and australia. the gross per capita income of a res in singapore is probably around s$70,000, he said, adding that this figure excludes operational costs, as well as yearly medisave contributions. an agents typical operational costs include personal marketing campaigns, data analytics, home staging, video production for clients homes and listings on property portals. the latter is essential for closing deals, agents said, and has been costing more as portals adjust their offerings of paid features that allow agents to boost listings. it's not unheard of for top agents to spend at least s$50,000 a year on listing fees alone. all these costs are borne entirely by agents, even if a deal doesn't pan out. clients can walk away anytime, said mr swan, who has had clients decide not to sell their homes after close to nine months of marketing. there is nothing you can do but to bear the losses. sometimes, sellers also engage multiple property agents. this sets up fierce competition among the agents, who'll have to boost listings non-stop in hopes of sealing the deal, said mr swan. property agents also stressed that being commission-based doesn't mean they should be seen as profit-motivated. mr swan said he once dissuaded a couple from investing in a property as it was not in line with their family needs and long-term goals. i can choose to close the deal, but i don't want to. for me, it's not always about commission, he said, adding that he believes in giving frank advice to clients to build long-term relationships. the number of property agents, set against singapores market size, has also raised concerns around an oversupply. about 65 per cent of senior property industry executives polled by nus last year thought so. nearly a quarter of the survey respondents felt there could be a cap on agent numbers. property agencies however pointed out to cna that not all registered agents are active. arguing that agents can be quite stretched especially during busy months, era's mr lim said the population of singapore has crossed 6 million and the number of properties has been increasing year after year ... how can we cut back on the number of agents? the agencies also rebuffed the idea of a cap, saying it could encourage agents to hold on to their licences and deter potentially more qualified new entrants. market forces will determine whether there are insufficient or too many agents in the market, orangetees chief executive officer justin quek said. mr pow from ngee ann polytechnic meanwhile noted that beyond housing, the real estate sector also covers commercial properties as well as customers looking to invest overseas. so while some of these segments may be saturated with agents, others may still require their services, he added. rather than a strict cap, raising entry standards and promoting ongoing professional development would likely be more effective. this approach ensures that (agents) entering the field are well-trained while allowing the market to remain flexible to changes in demand. nonetheless, a bigger pool of agents in a slowing property market means that competition is heating up. amid feedback from some agents about rising operating costs, orangetee will let agents receive 100 per cent of the commission from new launches with effect immediately for the next nine months. property agencies typically take a cut from their agents' commissions. agencies have also been chipping in on the technological front. propnex, for one, offers in-house marketing and digital platforms to help its agents reach clients more efficiently, minimising unnecessary expenditures. from october next year, cea will require property agents to clock 16 hours of training a year, up from six to nine hours currently, to renew their licences. nus professor sing said this would help further professionalise the industry, but he also suggested that stricter regulations might help eradicate unethical practices such as misleading listings with unrealistic asking prices. seaa, on its end, has partnered property agencies and listing portals to develop a prototype aiming to tackle fake listings. after two years of work, the prototype has been handed over to cea. if this is put in place, agents will have to go through this platform to get their listings checked and verified before the listings can be posted on any property portals, said the association's president mr wang. in response to queries including on initiatives to raise standards, cea said property agents are expected to uphold high standards of professionalism and ethical conduct when carrying out their work ... we will continue to work closely with the industry to enhance professional and ethical standards amongst property agencies and agents to ensure that consumers interests are protected. industry players told cna that the fundamental value of a property agent now goes beyond just connecting buyers and sellers. they need to act as consultants, guiding their clients through market trends, analysing pros and cons, and ultimately helping them make informed decisions, said propnex's mr lim. this is especially the case for more complex or emotional transactions, such as helping a grieving family to sell a flat belonging to a deceased family member. in such a situation, agents can help navigate the necessary steps during this difficult period and even, at times, act as a bridge to discuss the sale sensitively with other family members, said mr wang. this was why mr aaron koh took the plunge to become a property agent after 16 years as a teacher. the 44-year-old first got interested in real estate about two years ago, after selling his first home in a process he described as emotional, physical and financial. he had great help then from a property agent who handled both the sale and the search for a new place. he arranged for viewings, helped me with the legwork and especially the timeline between selling my old place and getting my new home ready, recalled mr koh. in the process, my wife got pregnant so we decided to delay the moving and my agent helped to re-negotiate the timeline. these are all things that i would not have done on my own. the experience prompted a career switch and since joining huttons asia a month ago, mr koh has been undergoing training and working the ground at roadshows and new launches as well as by knocking on doors. i want to make this work as a long-term career, he said. i definitely hope to see success, but i will be patient. right now, its about levelling up my knowledge and making sure people can trust me.",1
rules,CNA,Politics,Government Policies,16/10/2024 7:48,1.2962727,103.8501578,Bras Basah,"singapore mr lee hsien yang, the youngest son of singapore's founding prime minister lee kuan yew, said on tuesday (oct 15) that he would apply to demolish their family home at 38 oxley road. this came days after his sister dr lee wei ling died. the only daughter of mr lee kuan yew had continued living at 38 oxley road after her father's death in 2015. mr lee hsien yang said his decision was in accordance with his parents' wishes, and that he was now the sole legal owner of the house. the urban redevelopment authority (ura) and building and construction authority (bca) said in response to cna's queries that they have not received any applications regarding 38 oxley road. the property at 38 oxley road was built in the late 19th century, and mr lee kuan yew lived there from the 1940s until his death. the house is associated with key events in singapore's history. founding fathers such as dr goh keng swee and dr toh chin chye held meetings in its basement dining room in the 1950s, which led formation of today's ruling peoples action party (pap). mr lee kuan yews children - senior minister lee hsien loong, the late dr lee and mr lee hsien yang - also grew up at 38 oxley road. mr lee kuan yew had on several occasions publicly expressed his wish for the house to be demolished after his death. he stated in a letter cabinet in october 2010 that it should not be kept as a kind of relic for people to tramp through and that it has no merit as architecture. in his book hard truths to keep singapore going, published in january 2011, he was quoted as saying because of my house the neighbouring houses cannot build high. now demolish my house and change the planning rules, go up, the land value will go up. he reiterated his stance in july 2011 in another letter cabinet. but this met with opposition from cabinet ministers when he asked them about it. subsequently, in another letter cabinet in december 2011, mr lee said he had reflected on the matter after the cabinet was unanimous in saying the property should not be demolished and that he had decided that if it was to be preserved, work needed to be carried out. the house should have its foundations reinforced and the whole building refurbished, and then be let out for people to live in, as an empty building will soon decline and decay, he said. yet in his final will executed in 2013, mr lee returned to saying he wanted the house to be demolished, and if that were not possible, the property should be closed to everyone except family and descendants. the family home became a subject of public interest after mr lee kuan yew's death on mar 23, 2015. on jun 14, 2017, mr lee hsien yang and dr lee took to social media to accuse mr lee hsien loong, who was prime minister at the time, of misrepresenting their father for political gain. they stressed that their father had wanted 38 oxley road to be demolished. mr lee hsien yang and dr lee said they felt threatened in trying to fulfil this wish of their fathers. they also accused mr lee hsien loong of abusing his influence in government to drive a personal agenda. a day later, mr lee hsien loong uploaded a five-page statement on facebook stating he had serious questions about how the last will of his father was prepared. he said that when mr lee kuan yew's last will was read on april 12, 2015, mr lee hsien yang had repeatedly insisted on demolishing the house immediately and that the discussion ended only when dr lee said she wished to continue living in the house. in his statement, mr lee hsien loong also said he had not challenged the validity of his father's last will in court, as he hoped to avoid a public fight that would tarnish mr lee kuan yew's and his familys name and reputation. upon mr lee kuan yew's death, his estate was divided equally among the three siblings, and his final will included a clause that allowed dr lee to stay there for as long as she desired. to resolve the family dispute amicably, mr lee hsien loong said he was prepared to transfer his share of 38 oxley road to dr lee for a nominal sum of s$1, on the condition that should the property be transacted later or acquired by the government, all proceeds would go to charity. but a resolution proved impossible. after the 2015 general election in september, dr lee and mr lee hsien yang agreed to a fresh proposal by mr lee hsien loong to transfer his 38 oxley road share to mr lee hsien yang at market value, on the condition that the brothers each donated an amount equivalent to half of that value to charity. this was to pre-empt any future controversies over compensation or redevelopment proceeds. mr lee hsien loong said he was prepared to do this so that his brother and dr lee could handle the 38 oxley road matter as they saw fit between them. this is consistent with the position that i had always held and conveyed to my family that it is not tenable for the family to retain proceeds from any dealing with 38 oxley road, as it would look like the family is opposing acquisition and preservation of the house for monetary reasons, said mr lee hsien loong at the time. lee hsien yang was and continues to be unhappy about my taking this position. so, it would appear, is lee wei ling, mr lee hsien loong had said. five days after his siblings first went public with their accusations, mr lee hsien loong apologised to singaporeans for the effect it had on the country's reputation, and singaporeans' confidence in the government. in a statement on jun 19, 2017, he added that as the eldest of the siblings, it grieves me to think of the anguish that this would have caused our parents if they were still alive. the saga made headlines in some of the world's biggest newspapers, which led to mr lee hsien loong delivering a ministerial statement in parliament on jul 3, 2017. urging all members of parliament to examine the issues thoroughly and question me and my cabinet colleagues vigorously, he said he hoped a full airing of the issue would dispel doubts and strengthen confidence in the country's institutions and system of government. a ministerial committee on 38 oxley road was convened to consider the fate of the house. it is chaired by senior minister and coordinating minister for national security teo chee hean, and included then minister for culture, community and youth grace fu, minister for law k shanmugam and then minister for national development lawrence wong. the latter is now prime minister. in april 2018, the committee released a final report on the matter, with three proposals retaining the house in whole retaining just the historic basement dining room or allowing it to be demolished. in reaching our views on mr lee kuan yew's wishes, we relied particularly on the objective evidence placed before us and the key concrete steps that mr lee kuan yew himself took in his lifetime to put his wishes into effect, mr teo said previously. this included the demolition clause in mr lee kuan yew's last will, his letter to cabinet dated dec 27, 2011, as well as the renovationredevelopment plans for 38 oxley road, which he submitted ura in march 2012, and obtained approval for. the report did not make any recommendations and noted there (was) no need to make a decision on the property at the time, as dr lee was still living there. the various options in the report are meant to help a future government make an informed and considered decision when the need arises, the committee said. in the final version of his will in 2013, mr lee kuan yew said he wanted the house to be demolished. if that were not possible, the property should be closed to everyone except family and descendants. in his ministerial statement in 2017, mr lee hsien loong pointed out that the clause about the demolition had been removed in the fifth and sixth versions of the will, and only reinserted in the seventh and final will. the first six wills were prepared by mr lee kuan yew's lawyer, madam kwa kim li, between august 2011 and november 2012. she was not involved in preparing the seventh and final will, executed on dec 17, 2013 with the involvement of mr lee hsien yang and his wife mrs lee suet fern, a lawyer. mrs lee suet fern was later found guilty in 2020 of grossly improper professional conduct in her handling of her father-in-law's last will. a disciplinary tribunal as well as the court of three judges - the highest disciplinary body dealing with lawyers' misconduct - found that mr lee hsien yang and mrs lee suet fern misled the late mr lee in the context of the execution of his last will, and that they had lied under oath during the proceedings. mr lee hsien yang and mrs lee suet fern left singapore in 2022 after deciding not to attend a scheduled police interview related matter. earlier in october, mr lee hsien yang posted on facebook saying he would not return to singapore for his sisters wake and funeral. mdm kwa was also ordered to pay s$13,000 in penalties over misconduct in relation late mr lees wills in 2023. she had to pay s$5,000 for failing to scrupulously safeguard the late mr lee's confidentiality while handling his will, and s$8,000 for misleading mr lee hsien yang and dr lee in an email response to their queries. this was after mr lee hsien yang and dr lee, as executors of their father's estate, made four complaints against mdm kwa, of which two were eventually referred to a disciplinary tribunal. the first claimed that mdm kwa breached privilege and duties of confidentiality by sending emails with records of communications with mr lee kuan yew to all three children, even though mr lee hsien loong was not an executor of the estate. the second alleged that she had given false and misleading information executors in her emails. in his facebook post on tuesday, mr lee hsien yang confirmed that with the passing of his sister, he was now the sole legal owner of 38 oxley road. lee hsien loong said in parliament in 2015 that when wei ling passed, it would be up government of the day to decide whether to allow demolition, mr lee hsien yang wrote in his post. it has been nine years. that day is today. in response to cna's queries, the ministry of national development (mnd) said it has noted mr lee hsien yangs intention to apply for the demolition of the house. (the) government will carefully consider issues related property in due course, taking into account mr lee kuan yews wishes and the public interest, including considering any applications with regard property, mnd said in its statement. mr lee hsien yangs application is likely to be long-drawn since the government has yet to decide on the future of 38 oxley road, said political commentator eugene tan. he also said the matter was unlikely to be an issue at elections, which must be held by november 2025. even if any party seeks to make it an issue, it is unlikely to be one that voters will be deeply concerned about, he added. but it is an issue that the ruling party would rather not distract voters from their election manifesto. dr mustafa izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at solaris strategies, echoed that view. i think there are other factors that are more pressing and perhaps more of a determinant as far as the electoral outcome is concerned, he added. the issue may come up during campaigning, but is unlikely to sway votes, said dr mustafa. but if it becomes a lot more heated, intense and it continues to drag on, then maybe, he added, noting that there is still quite a runway until the next elections. while the 2018 ministerial committee report offers three options, the cabinet is not bound by any of them, said assoc prof tan. he said there were pros and cons proposed fates of 38 oxley road - demolishing the house keeps wishes of mr lee kuan yew and his wife, while preserving the house has heritage or historical value. this also does not have to be a binary decision and there can be a solution halfway between the two, so that the issue need not be contested in the public eye, the associate professor of law at singapore management university noted. he suggested, for example, that the basement dining room be relocated to a founders memorial currently being constructed. noting that 38 oxley road is private property that has a large amount of public interest because of its history, dr mustafa similarly called for the government to negotiate a compromise about how to deal with the house. i think if the government takes that kind of approach it would go down well with the population.",1

(the) government will carefully consider issues related property in due course, taking into account mr lee kuan yews wishes and the public interest, including considering any applications with regard property, mnd said in its statement. mr lee hsien yangs application is likely to be long-drawn since the government has yet to decide on the future of 38 oxley road, said political commentator eugene tan. he also said the matter was unlikely to be an issue at elections, which must be held by november 2025. even if any party seeks to make it an issue, it is unlikely to be one that voters will be deeply concerned about, he added. but it is an issue that the ruling party would rather not distract voters from their election manifesto. dr mustafa izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at solaris strategies, echoed that view. i think there are other factors that are more pressing and perhaps more of a determinant as far as the electoral outcome is concerned, he added. the issue may come up during campaigning, but is unlikely to sway votes, said dr mustafa. but if it becomes a lot more heated, intense and it continues to drag on, then maybe, he added, noting that there is still quite a runway until the next elections. while the 2018 ministerial committee report offers three options, the cabinet is not bound by any of them, said assoc prof tan. he said there were pros and cons proposed fates of 38 oxley road - demolishing the house keeps wishes of mr lee kuan yew and his wife, while preserving the house has heritage or historical value. this also does not have to be a binary decision and there can be a solution halfway between the two, so that the issue need not be contested in the public eye, the associate professor of law at singapore management university noted. he suggested, for example, that the basement dining room be relocated to a founders memorial currently being constructed. noting that 38 oxley road is private property that has a large amount of public interest because of its history, dr mustafa similarly called for the government to negotiate a compromise about how to deal with the house. i think if the government takes that kind of approach it would go down well with the population.",0
culture,CNA,Politics,Government Policies,16/10/2024 7:48,1.2962727,103.8501578,Bras Basah,"singapore mr lee hsien yang, the youngest son of singapore's founding prime minister lee kuan yew, said on tuesday (oct 15) that he would apply to demolish their family home at 38 oxley road. this came days after his sister dr lee wei ling died. the only daughter of mr lee kuan yew had continued living at 38 oxley road after her father's death in 2015. mr lee hsien yang said his decision was in accordance with his parents' wishes, and that he was now the sole legal owner of the house. the urban redevelopment authority (ura) and building and construction authority (bca) said in response to cna's queries that they have not received any applications regarding 38 oxley road. the property at 38 oxley road was built in the late 19th century, and mr lee kuan yew lived there from the 1940s until his death. the house is associated with key events in singapore's history. founding fathers such as dr goh keng swee and dr toh chin chye held meetings in its basement dining room in the 1950s, which led formation of today's ruling peoples action party (pap). mr lee kuan yews children - senior minister lee hsien loong, the late dr lee and mr lee hsien yang - also grew up at 38 oxley road. mr lee kuan yew had on several occasions publicly expressed his wish for the house to be demolished after his death. he stated in a letter cabinet in october 2010 that it should not be kept as a kind of relic for people to tramp through and that it has no merit as architecture. in his book hard truths to keep singapore going, published in january 2011, he was quoted as saying because of my house the neighbouring houses cannot build high. now demolish my house and change the planning rules, go up, the land value will go up. he reiterated his stance in july 2011 in another letter cabinet. but this met with opposition from cabinet ministers when he asked them about it. subsequently, in another letter cabinet in december 2011, mr lee said he had reflected on the matter after the cabinet was unanimous in saying the property should not be demolished and that he had decided that if it was to be preserved, work needed to be carried out. the house should have its foundations reinforced and the whole building refurbished, and then be let out for people to live in, as an empty building will soon decline and decay, he said. yet in his final will executed in 2013, mr lee returned to saying he wanted the house to be demolished, and if that were not possible, the property should be closed to everyone except family and descendants. the family home became a subject of public interest after mr lee kuan yew's death on mar 23, 2015. on jun 14, 2017, mr lee hsien yang and dr lee took to social media to accuse mr lee hsien loong, who was prime minister at the time, of misrepresenting their father for political gain. they stressed that their father had wanted 38 oxley road to be demolished. mr lee hsien yang and dr lee said they felt threatened in trying to fulfil this wish of their fathers. they also accused mr lee hsien loong of abusing his influence in government to drive a personal agenda. a day later, mr lee hsien loong uploaded a five-page statement on facebook stating he had serious questions about how the last will of his father was prepared. he said that when mr lee kuan yew's last will was read on april 12, 2015, mr lee hsien yang had repeatedly insisted on demolishing the house immediately and that the discussion ended only when dr lee said she wished to continue living in the house. in his statement, mr lee hsien loong also said he had not challenged the validity of his father's last will in court, as he hoped to avoid a public fight that would tarnish mr lee kuan yew's and his familys name and reputation. upon mr lee kuan yew's death, his estate was divided equally among the three siblings, and his final will included a clause that allowed dr lee to stay there for as long as she desired. to resolve the family dispute amicably, mr lee hsien loong said he was prepared to transfer his share of 38 oxley road to dr lee for a nominal sum of s$1, on the condition that should the property be transacted later or acquired by the government, all proceeds would go to charity. but a resolution proved impossible. after the 2015 general election in september, dr lee and mr lee hsien yang agreed to a fresh proposal by mr lee hsien loong to transfer his 38 oxley road share to mr lee hsien yang at market value, on the condition that the brothers each donated an amount equivalent to half of that value to charity. this was to pre-empt any future controversies over compensation or redevelopment proceeds. mr lee hsien loong said he was prepared to do this so that his brother and dr lee could handle the 38 oxley road matter as they saw fit between them. this is consistent with the position that i had always held and conveyed to my family that it is not tenable for the family to retain proceeds from any dealing with 38 oxley road, as it would look like the family is opposing acquisition and preservation of the house for monetary reasons, said mr lee hsien loong at the time. lee hsien yang was and continues to be unhappy about my taking this position. so, it would appear, is lee wei ling, mr lee hsien loong had said. five days after his siblings first went public with their accusations, mr lee hsien loong apologised to singaporeans for the effect it had on the country's reputation, and singaporeans' confidence in the government. in a statement on jun 19, 2017, he added that as the eldest of the siblings, it grieves me to think of the anguish that this would have caused our parents if they were still alive. the saga made headlines in some of the world's biggest newspapers, which led to mr lee hsien loong delivering a ministerial statement in parliament on jul 3, 2017. urging all members of parliament to examine the issues thoroughly and question me and my cabinet colleagues vigorously, he said he hoped a full airing of the issue would dispel doubts and strengthen confidence in the country's institutions and system of government. a ministerial committee on 38 oxley road was convened to consider the fate of the house. it is chaired by senior minister and coordinating minister for national security teo chee hean, and included then minister for culture, community and youth grace fu, minister for law k shanmugam and then minister for national development lawrence wong. the latter is now prime minister. in april 2018, the committee released a final report on the matter, with three proposals retaining the house in whole retaining just the historic basement dining room or allowing it to be demolished. in reaching our views on mr lee kuan yew's wishes, we relied particularly on the objective evidence placed before us and the key concrete steps that mr lee kuan yew himself took in his lifetime to put his wishes into effect, mr teo said previously. this included the demolition clause in mr lee kuan yew's last will, his letter to cabinet dated dec 27, 2011, as well as the renovationredevelopment plans for 38 oxley road, which he submitted ura in march 2012, and obtained approval for. the report did not make any recommendations and noted there (was) no need to make a decision on the property at the time, as dr lee was still living there. the various options in the report are meant to help a future government make an informed and considered decision when the need arises, the committee said. in the final version of his will in 2013, mr lee kuan yew said he wanted the house to be demolished. if that were not possible, the property should be closed to everyone except family and descendants. in his ministerial statement in 2017, mr lee hsien loong pointed out that the clause about the demolition had been removed in the fifth and sixth versions of the will, and only reinserted in the seventh and final will. the first six wills were prepared by mr lee kuan yew's lawyer, madam kwa kim li, between august 2011 and november 2012. she was not involved in preparing the seventh and final will, executed on dec 17, 2013 with the involvement of mr lee hsien yang and his wife mrs lee suet fern, a lawyer. mrs lee suet fern was later found guilty in 2020 of grossly improper professional conduct in her handling of her father-in-law's last will. a disciplinary tribunal as well as the court of three judges - the highest disciplinary body dealing with lawyers' misconduct - found that mr lee hsien yang and mrs lee suet fern misled the late mr lee in the context of the execution of his last will, and that they had lied under oath during the proceedings. mr lee hsien yang and mrs lee suet fern left singapore in 2022 after deciding not to attend a scheduled police interview related matter. earlier in october, mr lee hsien yang posted on facebook saying he would not return to singapore for his sisters wake and funeral. mdm kwa was also ordered to pay s$13,000 in penalties over misconduct in relation late mr lees wills in 2023. she had to pay s$5,000 for failing to scrupulously safeguard the late mr lee's confidentiality while handling his will, and s$8,000 for misleading mr lee hsien yang and dr lee in an email response to their queries. this was after mr lee hsien yang and dr lee, as executors of their father's estate, made four complaints against mdm kwa, of which two were eventually referred to a disciplinary tribunal. the first claimed that mdm kwa breached privilege and duties of confidentiality by sending emails with records of communications with mr lee kuan yew to all three children, even though mr lee hsien loong was not an executor of the estate. the second alleged that she had given false and misleading information executors in her emails. in his facebook post on tuesday, mr lee hsien yang confirmed that with the passing of his sister, he was now the sole legal owner of 38 oxley road. lee hsien loong said in parliament in 2015 that when wei ling passed, it would be up government of the day to decide whether to allow demolition, mr lee hsien yang wrote in his post. it has been nine years. that day is today. in response to cna's queries, the ministry of national development (mnd) said it has noted mr lee hsien

manipulated content of candidates during elections. the elections (integrity of online advertising) (amendment) bill, which was tabled by the ministry of digital development and information (mddi) last month, prohibits the publication of digitally generated or manipulated content during elections that realistically depicts a candidate saying or doing something that they did not say or do. this will only apply to online election advertising that depicts people who are running as candidates. it will take effect once the writ of election is issued and until the close of polling, and will only apply if four conditions are fulfilled if the content fulfils all four conditions, it would be a criminal offence to publish it as well as to share or repost it. mddi said previously that minor modifications such as beauty filters will not be covered as they do not capture the candidate doing or saying something they did not do. animated characters or cartoons, as well as entertainment content and memes that are not realistic, are also excluded. during her speech on tuesday, minister for digital development and information josephine teo said it does not matter if the content is favourable or unfavourable to any candidate. she added that the publication of such prohibited content during an election period, as well as the boosting, sharing and reposting of the content, will be an offence. the passing of the law comes amid an increase in deepfake incidents in countries during their election period. in january, a fake version of us president joe bidens voice was featured in robocalls that sought to discourage democrats from participating in the new hampshire presidential primary. during last years slovakian parliamentary elections, a deepfake audio of a politician discussing electoral rigging was posted online and went viral. the candidate later lost the elections despite having earlier led in the polls. singapore's next general election must be held by november 2025. mrs teo said ai-generated misinformation can seriously threaten democratic foundations, adding that it demands an equally serious response. she played a 38-second video of herself generated by ai to illustrate how easily and quickly deepfakes can be produced. if the deepfake video you just watched did not convince you of its impersonation of me, more advanced versions soon will, she said. the bill is a carefully calibrated response to augment singapore's election laws, ensuring that the truthfulness of candidate representation and the integrity of elections continue to be upheld, she said. members of parliament (mps) largely supported the bill but had concerns about its definitions and the potential for political overreach. they also had questions about how the law would be enforced and the circulation of deepfakes on private messaging channels. mp he ting ru (wp-sengkang) and mp vikram nair (pap-sembawang) questioned how the law would regulate deepfake content shared through private messaging channels such as whatsapp and telegram, and how to prevent them from being circulated further. if a person forwards a video to several hundred people on his contact list that may be more damaging than the same video on a facebook account precisely because the message comes from a trusted source in a private message channel, said mr nair. mp yip hon weng (pap-yio chu kang) pointed out that terms in the bill such as realistic but false representations and manipulated content are broad and could cause confusion, inconsistent application or potential overreach in enforcement. clear definitions and guidelines are important. they ensure that this law meets its purpose while avoiding the stifling of legitimate political expression, he said. questions were also posed on whether the enforcement of the law would remain free from unfair allegations of political bias, as well as the need for timely follow-ups during the campaign period. responding to mps concerns about content shared via private or domestic communications, mrs teo said the election rules are not intended to police such conversations. when deciding whether a communication is of a private or domestic nature, she said the returning officer (ro) will consider various factors, such as the number of individuals in singapore who can access the content, as well as the relationships between the individuals in the chat groups. as an example, chat groups on whatsapp and telegram with very large memberships that anyone can freely join should not be considered private or domestic communication, she added. if prohibited content is circulated in these open groups, the ro will assess if action should be taken. as to whether candidates can request for corrective directions to be issued, mrs teo said that significant weight will be placed on the depicted candidates declaration ro, as they would be in the best position to clarify if the content was an accurate representation of themselves.",1

rules,CNA,Politics,Government Policies,15/10/2024 21:52,1.3868121,103.8914433,Buangkok,"singapore singapore's parliament passed a law on tuesday (oct 15) that would ban deepfakes and other digitally manipulated content of candidates during elections. the elections (integrity of online advertising) (amendment) bill, which was tabled by the ministry of digital development and information (mddi) last month, prohibits the publication of digitally generated or manipulated content during elections that realistically depicts a candidate saying or doing something that they did not say or do. this will only apply to online election advertising that depicts people who are running as candidates. it will take effect once the writ of election is issued and until the close of polling, and will only apply if four conditions are fulfilled if the content fulfils all four conditions, it would be a criminal offence to publish it as well as to share or repost it. mddi said previously that minor modifications such as beauty filters will not be covered as they do not capture the candidate doing or saying something they did not do. animated characters or cartoons, as well as entertainment content and memes that are not realistic, are also excluded. during her speech on tuesday, minister for digital development and information josephine teo said it does not matter if the content is favourable or unfavourable to any candidate. she added that the publication of such prohibited content during an election period, as well as the boosting, sharing and reposting of the content, will be an offence. the passing of the law comes amid an increase in deepfake incidents in countries during their election period. in january, a fake version of us president joe bidens voice was featured in robocalls that sought to discourage democrats from participating in the new hampshire presidential primary. during last years slovakian parliamentary elections, a deepfake audio of a politician discussing electoral rigging was posted online and went viral. the candidate later lost the elections despite having earlier led in the polls. singapore's next general election must be held by november 2025. mrs teo said ai-generated misinformation can seriously threaten democratic foundations, adding that it demands an equally serious response. she played a 38-second video of herself generated by ai to illustrate how easily and quickly deepfakes can be produced. if the deepfake video you just watched did not convince you of its impersonation of me, more advanced versions soon will, she said. the bill is a carefully calibrated response to augment singapore's election laws, ensuring that the truthfulness of candidate representation and the integrity of elections continue to be upheld, she said. members of parliament (mps) largely supported the bill but had concerns about its definitions and the potential for political overreach. they also had questions about how the law would be enforced and the circulation of deepfakes on private messaging channels. mp he ting ru (wp-sengkang) and mp vikram nair (pap-sembawang) questioned how the law would regulate deepfake content

rules,CNA,Politics,Government Policies,15/10/2024 13:55,1.3483099,103.6831347,Pioneer,"singapore the singapore governments decision to block the income-allianz deal was both surprising and extraordinary, but most of all, it was the right call. when the matter was discussed in parliament in august, there wasnt a hint that it would not approve the sale of income insurances shares german financial services company. more than a dozen members of parliament had filed questions on how the proposed sale would affect the social mission of the former cooperative, which had been set up to provide affordable insurance to low-income workers. they were reflecting widespread public concern over whether allianz, a commercial profit-driven, publicly listed company could be counted on to keep faith with the values of a social enterprise. the responses from both second minister for finance chee hong tat and minister of state for culture, community and youth alvin tan then were matter-of-fact and non-committal, reiterating the point that the two entities had stated they intend to honour existing commitments to policyholders and that the government would hold them accountable. it was not reassuring to critics of the deal and most observers concluded at the time that it was a done deal. mondays (oct 14) announcement by culture, community and youth minister edwin tong was a bolt from the blue by a government that rarely acts out of character. because there is now a new prime minister in charge, questions will invariably be raised about what it says of his leadership and whether it heralds a change in style if not substance. does it? there are several takeaways. first, whatever the decision, the authorities have always been consistent in ensuring that their actions are above board and comply with existing rules. if the deal meets all the requirements of the monetary authority of singapore (mas) and the registrar of cooperatives, it cannot be arbitrarily blocked without seriously damaging singapores reputation as a leading financial centre based on the rule of law. as far as the mas was concerned, there was nothing amiss about the proposed transaction under existing law. it did not have the power to block it, which is why there is now going to be new legislation, which will be rushed through parliament this week, to enable it to do so. on this front, there has been no change in the governments approach. according to mr tong, the penny dropped when his ministry which oversees the cooperative movement discovered that allianz had proposed, as part of the deal, to return s$1.85 billion to shareholders over three years to reduce the companys capital holdings. such a move, he added, was contrary to what income had said two years earlier when it was in discussion with the ministry of culture, community and youth (mccy) about changing its identity from a cooperative to a company. this was how the minister put it we find it difficult to reconcile the proposed substantial capital reduction, soon after the transaction is completed, with incomes representations to mccy during the corporatisation exercise, that it was aiming to build up capital resources and enhance its financial strength. in effect, he was saying that income had not kept to its promise made earlier. he was even more blunt when speaking about whether it could fulfil its social mission, which was the main concern of many people when the proposed sale was first announced. mccy is not satisfied that income will be able to continue fulfilling its social mission after the proposed transaction. there are no clear binding provisions or structural protections in the deal to ensure that incomes social mission will be discharged. ouch! these disclosures have made income look inept and out of touch. it was effectively thrown under the bus. much now rests on the quality of incomes management and board to overcome this setback, and make changes if necessary, including to its own organisational structure. dare singaporeans hope that as a result, it will be even more committed to its social mission and deliver on it. it also raises the intriguing question whether there was a less public way to prevail on income to walk away from the deal, even if it meant paying a financial penalty to allianz. given the government's close association with the labour movement which owns a substantial part of income through ntuc enterprise, such a move was not inconceivable. that it was not done and instead the government opted for a more transparent and direct way to stop the deal speaks much about its modus operandi. it has now made clear where it stands on the labour movements social mission to support low-income workers. the message on monday could not have been delivered more loudly. it also says something about the new leaderships willingness to act when there are important principles at stake. is there a danger that there will be more public pressure for the government to intervene or reverse its decision over other issues? on social media, one popular refrain has been that with the impending general election, the government is more sensitive to public feedback. so time to up the noise level? there is nothing new in this sort of talk and every government faces the political challenge of making difficult decisions and balancing the interests of different groups. thats what politics is about. a new prime minister might face a more testing time in this regard. since his inauguration, prime minister lawrence wong has articulated his vision for singapore on a wide range of issues, including listening to public feedback before making decisions, valuing diversity and developing a less academic-centric society. he has said most of the right things but there are questions about what he will actually do to put his vision into effect. the income-allianz decision will count as one such marker. han fook kwang was a veteran newspaper editor and is senior fellow at the s rajaratnam school of international studies, nanyang technological university.",1

(the singapore shows dont use dubbed audio.) instead, i remained transfixed by the casts physical gestures and facial expressions, only enhanced by the elaborate costumes and set design. the spectacle on stage showed me everything i was certain the most eloquent english translation couldnt convey a decidedly apt impression of a play ultimately tackling the big, messy, uncomfortable feelings no human is immune to, whether ancient hunnu or modern singaporean. actress bayra bela, who plays queen tsetser in the english version, shared that some people have classified the mongol khan as a musical, while others have highlighted its operatic elements. but ultimately, the play doesn't quite fit into a distinct theatre category, and that could be its winning factor. we have a huge ensemble of dance. the story itself is very traditionally shakespearean. but then it's told (through) circus elements movie stunt people are involved, (we've got) contortionists, puppetry. it's very rich culturally, she said. it's not going to be just a one-night entertainment. it's going to be an exploration of a different culture and dimension. i want (people) to go home and start googling about mongolia, start talking to their friends about mongolia and get inspired to travel to mongolia. before catching the mongol khan, i only knew mongolia for its vast, rugged landscapes the stuff of every intrepid instagrammer's bucket list. i wasn't sure a theatre production would teach me anything about the country that i couldn't simply find online. but it took me just three hours to realise mongolia's deep-seated pride in its nomadic culture and an unfaltering desire to preserve this identity. there's also a seemingly innate, unfortunately unfamiliar, hunger in her people to fight for what one believes in. it's rarely convenient, sometimes impractical, often all-consuming, and perhaps exactly what singapore needs. cna lifestyle was in mongolia at the invitation of base entertainment asia, which is bringing the mongol khan to marina bay sands from oct 17. shows are staged in english or mongolian, with english and mandarin subtitles provided for all sessions. showtimes and ticketing details can be found here.",1
